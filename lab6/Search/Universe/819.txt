(June 2008) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Greater Vitória (Região Metropolitana da Grande Vitória) is a metropolitan area in southeastern Brazil. It is made up of the following municipalities: Cariacica, Fundão, Guarapari, Serra, Vitória, Vila Velha, and Viana and according to IBGE it covers an area of 2,331.01 km² with 1,627,651 inhabitants (2005). Trends and Influences[edit] The term Greater Vitória corresponds mainly to the area centered on Vitória, the capital of Espírito Santo, Brazil. Today the greatest part of industrial development is occurring in the Serra municipality, where many industries are building depots and factories. Those take advantage of the 3 Ports, Vitória Airport and the proximity to the ring road, which goes right though Serra, to distribute their products. The closest area of influence is Rio de Janeiro, followed by Belo Horizonte, then perhaps Salvador, in terms of commerce and cultural links.
