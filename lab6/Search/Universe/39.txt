Aubrey Drake Graham was born on October 24, 1986, in Toronto, Ontario to parents Sandi Graham (née Sher), an educator, and Dennis Graham, a drummer who worked with Jerry Lee Lewis. On his father's side, he is related to American musicians Larry Graham and Teenie Hodges, who are his uncles.[8][9][10][11][12] Drake's father is an African-American from Memphis, Tennessee, and Drake's mother is a caucasian Jewish Canadian. He attended a Jewish day school and had a Bar Mitzvah.[13][14][15] His parents divorced when he was five years old, and he was raised by his mother in two Toronto neighbourhoods; he lived on Weston Road in the city's working-class west end,[16] until the sixth grade, when he moved to the affluent Forest Hill.[17][18] In his youth, he played minor hockey with the Weston Red Wings.[19] Drake has commented on the move to Forest Hill and his mother's struggle, saying that "She wanted the best for her family. She found us a half of a house we could live in. The other people had the top half, we had the bottom half. I lived in the basement, my mom lived on the first floor. It was not big, it was not luxurious. It was what we could afford." Drake then began attending Forest Hill Collegiate Institute, where he began acting,[20] but did not graduate.[21] It was the first of two high schools he would attend, as he later went to Vaughan Road Academy, describing it as "not by any means the easiest school to go to. It's a tough school."[16] Despite dropping out of high school, years later, he graduated in October 2012.[22] Looking back on his early life, Drake had to essentially live two different lives because of his parents' divorce; he lived in an upper-class part of Toronto, and, when in Memphis, was told he was "the furthest thing from hood." He witnessed many life-changing experiences because of this, one being his father's arrest, which he describes by saying: "The fact that I didn't have a father, because he was in jail two separate times. He did a two-year bid and a three-year bid, I was there when he got taken down. We had just gotten back from Memphis." However, Drake comments on his childhood experiences by saying "I've seen things that didn't make me happy. They were character building. That's why I think people in the hood can still connect with what I'm saying even though I'm not saying 'yeah I got crack in my pocket' 'cause that wasn't my struggle necessarily, [but] I speak from a place that's just human emotion." Drake stated that his parents' divorce greatly affected him as a person, saying, "I had to become a man very quickly and be the backbone for a woman who I love with all my heart, my mother." At the age of 24, Drake commented on his early life by saying "I've seen a lot, man. I've seen a lot of life, put it that way. I've been with the most blessed kids in the world. I've been with people whose life is right at the bottom of the barrel. I was on a TV show, I went to art school, I went to hood schools. I've lived. I've lived a full 24 years, man."[16][23] Career 2001–05: Degrassi: The Next Generation At the age of 15, Drake met an agent, the father of a high school friend.[24] The agent found Drake a role on the Canadian TV show Degrassi: The Next Generation as Jimmy Brooks.[25] In the show, Brooks is a basketball star who became physically disabled after he was shot by a classmate. Drake describes how his early acting career affected his family, "My mother was very sick. We were very poor, like broke. The only money I had coming in was off of Canadian TV, which isn't that much money when you break it down. A season of Canadian television is under a teacher's salary, I'll tell you that much. It's definitely not something to go fucking get."[16] He would continue his acting career on Degrassi: The Next Generation until 2009, when his character graduated from Degrassi. Overall, he appeared in a total of 138 episodes.[citation needed] 2006–09: Mixtapes and So Far Gone In 2006, Drake self-released his first mixtape Room for Improvement. The mixtape features artists Trey Songz and Lupe Fiasco. He described it as "pretty straightforward, radio friendly, not much content to it." In a TeenNick interview from that time, he cited his influences as rappers Jay Z, Clipse, Talib Kweli, Mos Def and singers Anthony Hamilton and Maxwell.[25] In 2007, he released another mixtape, Comeback Season, spawning a single and a music video for "Replacement Girl" featuring Trey Songz. Also in 2007, Drake became the first unsigned Canadian rapper to have his music video featured on BET when his first single, "Replacement Girl" was featured as the "New Joint of the Day" on April 30, 2007.[26] It also contained a freestyle over a song with Lil Wayne, a remix of "Man of the Year" originally by Brisco and Flo Rida. In 2008, Lil Wayne was given some of Drake's music from Rap-A-Lot founder, J. Prince's son, Jas Prince, and he immediately called Drake to invite him to fly to Houston and tour with him. Drake and Wayne recorded a couple of songs during this time, including "Ransom", the original version of "I Want This Forever", and the remix to Drake's song, "Brand New". Though now part of Lil Wayne's crew, Young Money, Drake was not signed. On February 13, 2009, Drake released his third official mixtape, So Far Gone, for free download on his blog site, which included Drake's mentor Lil Wayne, Bun B, Omarion, Lloyd and his friend, Trey Songz. It received over 2,000 downloads in the first 2 hours of release. It was extremely successful in the underground and eventually made its way to radio. Due to the success of the mixtape's two singles, "Best I Ever Had" and "Successful", it was released as an EP featuring only five songs from the mix tape and one new song. MTV named it "The Hottest Mixtape of 2009 (So Far)".[27] Since So Far Gone, Drake worked with Rihanna, DJ Khaled, Young Money, Jay Z, Kanye West, Eminem, Young Jeezy, Mary J. Blige, Timbaland, Birdman, Trey Songz, and Jamie Foxx. Drake has also written for Alicia Keys, and Dr. Dre. So Far Gone is credited as being his commercial and critical breakthrough as it was much more critically acclaimed and commercially successful than his previous two releases.[citation needed] Drake performing on July 16, 2010 at the Cisco Ottowa Bluesfest He achieved success before signing to a major record label, according to his management Hip Hop Since 1978.[28] In June 2009, it was revealed that an unauthorized album entitled The Girls Love Drake and credited to Drake was up for sale on iTunes. A lawsuit was planned against the label.[29] On the Billboard Hot 100 chart of July 4, 2009, both "Best I Ever Had", and "Every Girl" by Young Money Entertainment entered the top ten at positions 3 and 10 respectively. Drake is only the second artist to have his first two top-ten entries in the same week. The first was fellow Canadian Nelly Furtado who entered the top ten in 2001 with "I'm Like A Bird" the same week as Missy Elliott's "Get Ur Freak On", a remix of which included a credited contribution from Furtado. On June 29, 2009, it was confirmed, that Drake signed a record deal with Young Money Entertainment.[30] This followed what Billboard purported to be "one of the biggest bidding wars ever".[31] Drake toured with Wayne and other rap artists on the America's Most Wanted Tour. On July 31, 2009, Drake, who was performing on an already injured knee, fell on stage while performing "Best I Ever Had", with Lil Wayne in Camden, New Jersey.[32] Drake underwent surgery on September 8, 2009 for a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his knee. He underwent rehabilitation and was soon able to walk.[33] On September 15, 2009, So Far Gone was released as a seven-track EP in which five of the tracks were from the original mixtape. It debuted at No. 6 on the Billboard 200. Since then the album was certified gold by the RIAA with over 500,000 copies sold in the United States. On April 18, 2010, the album won Rap Recording of the Year at the 2010 Juno Awards.[34] 2010–11: Thank Me Later Drake performing at the Fox Theater in 2010 Drake planned to release his official debut album, Thank Me Later, in late 2008, but the album's release date was postponed, first to March 2010,[35] then May 25, 2010.[36] Universal Motown then stated the album had been pushed back three weeks for a June 15, 2010, release.[35][37] Thank Me Later was finally released on June 15, 2010. On that day, 25,000 fans gathered at New York's South Street Seaport for a free concert by Drake and Hanson. A near-riot ensued after police cancelled the show due to overflowing crowds.[38] The week of the album's release, the album sold 447,000 copies and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.[39] Due to his first week sales, Drake had sold the most records for any hip hop artist in one week in 2010.[40] Eminem surpassed that accomplishment a week later.[41] The album has collaborations with the likes of Kanye West, Jay Z[42] and Lil Wayne while forgoing planned duets with Trey Songz[43] and Danny!.[43] On March 9, 2010, Drake released the first single from his Thank Me Later album, titled "Over".[44] The song was well-received and performed well both commercially and critically. The song reached a peak of No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the Billboard Rap Songs chart. The song also received a nomination for Best Rap Solo Performance at the 53rd Grammy Awards.[45] On March 12, 2010, a version of K'naan's "Wavin' Flag" recorded by a collective of Canadian musicians known as Young Artists for Haiti was released. Drake is featured in the song, performing a solo verse near the end of the song. In June 2010, it was announced that Drake would have a prominent role in the video game Gears of War 3. He was scheduled to play the part of Jace Stratton, but a scheduling conflict meant it went to someone else.[46] On April 29, 2010, it was announced that Drake had finished Thank Me Later. According to reports, Drake announced the completion of the album to a crowd during his April 26, 2010, show at the University of Missouri in Kansas City.[citation needed] "Find Your Love" was released as the second single on May 5, 2010. Critics commended Drake's attempt to move into the singing lane on the song, and compared it to Kanye West's work on 808s & Heartbreak. The single became the most successful single from the album, peaking at number 5 on the Hot 100 and receiving a Platinum certification by the RIAA.[47] "Find Your Love" also performed well internationally and was Drake's first top 40 appearance in the United Kingdom and Italy. To date it also remains Drake's only solo top 10 appearance in his home country of Canada. The music video for the single was shot in Kingston, Jamaica and tells the story of Drake being involved in a fateful encounter with a gang-affiliated woman. The video was criticized by Jamaica's minister of tourism, Edmund Bartlett who said "We just have to say that care has to be taken by all, including our creative artists, in portraying images of our destination and people, Gun culture, while not unique to Jamaica, is not enhancing [the island's image]"[48] The third single from the album, "Miss Me", featuring Lil Wayne, was released on June 1, 2010.[49] The single proved to be moderately successful, and reached No. 15 on the Hot 100.[50] The fourth and final single released from the album was "Fancy". The song was performed at the MTV Music Video Awards in 2010 with appearances by Swizz Beatz and Mary J. Blige in the performance.

Drake is known for his soft melody, emotionally sophisticated lyricism, technical ability, and integration of personal backstory. Most of his songs contain R&B and Canadian hip hop elements, and he combines rapping with singing.[5] He credits his father with the introduction of singing into his rap mixtapes, which have become a staple in his musical repertoire. His incorporation of melody into technically complex lyrics was supported by his mentor Lil Wayne and has subsequently been a critically acclaimed component to Drake's singles and albums.[129] His rapping ability has been noted as "polarizing", and has contributed to him being named one of the most divisive rappers of his generation by multiple critics and media publications.[130] R&B singer The- Dream, commented on Drake's singing stating that it was one of his most powerful tools to differentiate himself from other Hip Hop artists.[131] The sentiment was reiterated by prominent members of the music industry such as rapper Nelly,[132] singer Usher,[133] rapper Ghostface KIllah,[134] comedian Charlamagne tha God,[130] and R&B singer The Weekend.☃☃ His vocal abilities have been critically acclaimed for an audible contrast between typical hip hip beats and melody with sometimes abrasive rapping coupled with softer accents delivered on technical lyricism. Themes and lyricism The lyrical content that Drake is most known for is considered to be soulful, heartfelt, anguished, sophisticated, and genuine.[135] However, Drake is often revered for incorporating degrading themes of money, drug use, and women into new contexts. He does this through his augmentation of the typical meaning of phrases in which he combines an objective and subjective perspective into one vocal delivery. His songs often maintain tension between "pause and pace, tone timbre, and volume and vocal fermata."[136] Drake is credited with innovating what has been referred to as "hyper-reality rap" which is characterized as rapid fire cultural references integrated into highly complex technical lyricism coupled with melodic beats.[137] Drake has stated that he has been heavily influenced by Kanye West,[138] Jay Z,[139] Aaliyah,[140] and Lil Wayne.[141] Public image His cultural references over the start of career have moved from simply referencing events to creating terms and phrases widely accepted by other musical artists across genres, and the general public. He is credited for popularizing the phrase "YOLO" in the United States, with his single, "The Motto" stating: "You only live once: that's the motto, nigga, YOLO."[72] The term has been widely adopted by the general public used to advocate for a carpe diem lifestyle, it has been used to name restaurants,[142] albums, and countless of other popular culture institutions.[143][144] Drake began referring to his hometown of Toronto as "The Six" in early 2015, and has subsequently popularized the term to reference to town.[145][146] His release of the music video for "Hotline Bling", went viral due to Drake's artistic choices in singing and dancing.[147] The video has been remixed, memed, and was heavily commented on due to Drake's emotional side on the track as well as its production, while others were critical of its lyrical content, considering it sexist.[148] It subsequently gained popularity on YouTube and spawned several parodies of it.[149] His public image began to become established with his portrayal of as Jimmy Brooks, in Degrassi: The Next Generation,[25] in which he was viewed as "freshmen uncool." Through artistic reinvention and musical compulsion his public image was changed to portray a highly technical rapper capable of showing his softer side while remaining versatile in his artistry.[150] Drake made his most notable debut into Hip Hop, with So Far Gone, which introduced his emotional side and showcased his integration of public relationships with public figures in his music. Due to the high emotional value of his songs, his lyrics have been widely used on social media to as captions to photos or to reference emotions or personal situations.[151][152] Drake made his Saturday Night Live hosting debut on January 19, 2014; also serving as the musical guest. The episode received acclaim from critics who praised Drake's acting ability and comedic timing.[96][97][98] Fashion Drake's fashion choices have also been widely-covered on media platforms for their style, expensiveness, and product placement. Drake collaborated with Canada Goose, to produce a clothing line in conjunction with his own fashion label, October's Very Own.[153] Drake has been critiqued for his attire in his music videos and noted for his wearing of expensive clothing as exampled in his Hotline Bling video, in which he wore a $1,500 Moncler Puffer Jacket, a $400 Acne Studios turtleneck, and a pair of limited edition Timberland 6" Classic Boots.[154][155] His fashion choices in general also have been critiqued for their style. At award ceremonies, he has been sponsored by several fashion houses, and has been seen wearing custom made Tom Ford, Patagonia, Canada Goose, Burberry, Nike, Missoni, and Alexander McQueen.[156] He is an avid wearer of sweaters often wearing them on tour, at basketball games, in interviews and in general; it was reported that he had over 1,000 sweater in his possession.[157] Controversies In 2012, an ex-girlfriend sued Drake for using her voice without permission in his song "Marvins Room".[158] In 2014, Drake was charged $300,000 for sampling a 1982 song called "Jimmy Smith Rap", on one of his songs for not properly licensing it.[159][160] Later that year, Drake was again sued for $100,000 by rapper Rappin' 4-Tay for misusing his lyrics on the song "Who Do You Love?".[161] Drake held a widely covered feud with rapper Meek Mill which contested lyrical originality,[106][107][108][110] Mill's relationship with Nicki Manaj,[109][162] and their respective cities with respect to their NBA teams performance.[163][164][165] Rapper Pusha T began a brief feud with Drake featuring commentary on his single, "Exodus 23:1"[166] that disparaged Drake's connection to Lil Wayne's Young Money Records. Both rappers replied to the commentary in live shows ending the feud.[167][168][169] Common released a song titled "Sweet", which included lyrics critical of Drake given a recent MTV publicity stunt where Drake imitated Frank Sinatra. Drake responded to the criticism with his single "Stay Schemin'",[170][171] ending the feud.[172][173] Drake and Chris Brown were allegedly involved in a physical altercation in June 2012, when Drake and his entourage threw glass bottles at Brown in a SoHo nightclub in Manhattan, New York City.[174] Chris Brown tweeted about the incident and released a record criticizing Drake weeks later.[175][176] However, Brown and Drake both appeared in a comedic skit for the 2014 ESPY Awards, and rehearsed the skit together prior to the televised airing.[177] Tyga called Drake "fake" in an interview and said he "doesn't like him as a person".[178][179] Drake later then responded to him on his mixtape If You're Reading This It's Too Late and criticized his relationship with then underage Kylie Jenner.[180] Toronto Raptors On September 30, 2013, Drake was announced as the new "global ambassador" for the Toronto Raptors, thereby joining the executive committee of his hometown's National Basketball Association (NBA) team, in conjunction with the announcement of the 2016 NBA All-Star Game being awarded to the Air Canada Centre in Toronto.[181][182][183] In this role, he will help promote and serve as a host of festivities for the 2016 NBA All-Star Game, to be held in Toronto, as well as provide consulting services to rebrand the team and redesign its image and clothing line, in honour of its upcoming 20th anniversary, in the 2014–15 season.[184][185] The job includes his own staff, located in an office next to that of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment CEO Tim Leiweke.[185] In announcing the position, Drake noted that, "obviously, I won't be able to be in the building every day but I am extremely dedicated to it ... I do take it very seriously as a new job and a new chapter in my life."[186] During the 2013–14 season Drake along with the Toronto Raptors organization began hosting "Drake Nights" which started January 11, 2014.[187] On February 12, 2016, at the 2016 NBA All-Stars in his home town of Toronto, Drake was given The Key to the City by mayor John Tory.[188] Discography Main article: Drake discography Studio albums Thank Me Later (2010) Take Care (2011) Nothing Was the Same (2013) Views (2016) Commercial mixtapes If You're Reading This It's Too Late (2015) What a Time to Be Alive (with Future) (2015) Concert tours Headlining Away from Home Tour (2010) Club Paradise Tour (2012) Would You like a Tour?
