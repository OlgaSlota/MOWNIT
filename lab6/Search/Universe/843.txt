Diehl BGT Defence - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Diehl BGT Defence From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search Diehl BGT Defence GmbH & Ko KG is a German arms manufacturer and a subsidiary of the Diehl Stiftung GmbH with headquarters in Überlingen. Diehl BGT Defence mainly produces missiles and ammunition. The company was founded in 2004 as result of the merger of Bodenseewerke Gerätetechnik GmbH and Diehl Munitionssysteme GmbH & Co. KG. In 1960, Bodenseewerke Gerätetechnik became the prime contractor for the European production of the American Sidewinder AIM-9B air-to-air missile. Based on the experience with the Sidewinder, Diehl recently developed a progressive new seeker for a new type of short-range air-to-air missile - the IRIS-T. Reportedly, this missile has a much improved combat performance over the Sidewinder[citation needed]. IRIS-T is currently being adopted by the German Air Force and other European air forces[citation needed]. Diehl plans to deliver 4,000 IRIS-T missiles by 2011[citation needed]. Diehl Aerospace GmbH, a subsidiary of Diehl BGT Defence, produces avionic systems for aircraft manufacturers, such as Airbus and the Eurofighter GmbH. Today, Diehl BGT Defence has approx. 1,800 employees, and Diehl Aerospace has approx. 1,200 employees. Diehl Stiftung GmbH has approx. 11,000 employees. Diehl BGT Defence had also been severely criticized in the past for the production of cluster bombs and land mines[citation needed].
