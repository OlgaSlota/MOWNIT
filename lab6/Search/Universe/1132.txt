Just needs to be reorganized and broken up into coherent sections. P0per 06:20, 23 Jun 2005 (UTC) The bottom line of the article says that the entry was taken out from Britannica. Does this mean that the entry was transcribed word for word? And if so, should it still be reorganized and broken up into different sections? --doubleslash 23:41, Jun 23, 2005 (UTC) do u know where pictures of David Wilkie's artwork can be found. I just discovered a plate depicting "The Rent Day", after prying off an old art board covering it. I was cleaning house and almost threw it away because the frame was in such bad shape. Printed on the front is: London Published January 6th 1877 by the London Fine Art Association by kind permission of Mess ts Henry Graves & Co (Copyright) Engraved from the Original Picture in the Collection of the R Hon ble the Earl of Mulgrave to whome this Plate is respectfully dedicated by his Lordships obliged Serv David Wilkie & Abraham Raimbach DAV WILKIE RA PINXIT ABR RAIMBACH SCULPSIT The plate is just great with wonderful details. It had been folded in two places so it has creae lines from the center left and right and un and down. The details remain sharp and everyhing remains viewable from the numbers on the grandfather clock to the door key in the hand of the child dressed in white. It is too big for me to scan it into my PC. If anyone would care to reply my email is honoluludj@hotmail.com thanks dj Vandalism?[edit] 'In the works which Wilkie produced in his final period he punched his own mother in the face, with the detailed handling, the delicate finish ...' I would personally change it back I've no clue what it should be changed to. --98.215.162.228 (talk) 06:56, 21 March 2009 (UTC) Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:David_Wilkie_(artist)&oldid=688748011" Categories: Start-Class biography articles Start-Class biography (arts and entertainment) articles Unknown-importance biography (arts and entertainment) articles Arts and entertainment work group articles WikiProject Biography articles Unassessed visual arts articles WikiProject Visual arts articles Navigation menu Personal tools Not logged in Talk Contributions Create account Log in Namespaces Article Talk Variants Views Read Edit New section View history More Search Navigation Main page Contents Featured content Current events Random article Donate to Wikipedia Wikipedia store Interaction Help About Wikipedia Community portal Recent changes Contact page Tools What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Permanent link Page information Print/export Create a book Download as PDF Printable version Languages This page was last modified on 2 November 2015, at 20:48.
