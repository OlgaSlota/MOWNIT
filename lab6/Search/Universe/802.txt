Its local government areas are the Melbourne and Yarra. At the 2011 Census, Carlton North had a population of 6,220. The suburb is bordered by Princes Street and Cemetery Road to the south, Royal Parade to the west, Nicholson Street to the east and Park Street to the north. Carlton North is home to the Melbourne General Cemetery and the Princes Park, which contains the Princes Park Football Ground. Its main commercial area is along Rathdowne Street, which has numerous cafés, restaurants, small fashion boutiques, bookshops and other businesses. Today, Carlton North, like other inner-northern suburbs of Melbourne, contains a mixture of white-collar professionals, bureaucrats and academics. The area has become more gentrified than Fitzroy North, Brunswick or Collingwood, resulting in significantly higher median property prices.

Previous cemetery sites at Flagstaff Gardens and (what is now) Queen Victoria Market had become full, thus the new Carlton North site was established. In the same year a prison stockade, Collingwood Stockade, was built on Lee Street. This subsequently became an asylum until 1873 when it became the area's first primary school. A bluestone quarry was established at what is now Curtain Square. Subdivision into residential blocks began in 1869, with the emerging brick terrace houses standing in contrast to Carlton's timber cottages. Princes Park was established in 1844 and became home to the Carlton Football Club in 1864. Tram lines were installed along Lygon Street, Rathdowne Street (dismantled in 1936), and Nicholson Street. The area was also serviced by the Inner Circle railway line (passenger services were ceased in 1948 although it remained a goods line until 1980).

The most notable businesses in the area include the original La Porchetta pizza restaurant (which has since become an Australia and New Zealand-wide franchise) and the Natural Tucker Bakery. In 2010 St Michael's Anglican Church celebrated its 125th anniversary. Carlton North also has one of the oldest mosques in Melbourne. Originally built by Albanian migrants, it is attended by Muslims during the 5 daily obligatory prayer sessions. Housing[edit] Carlton North has a large amount of Victorian and Edwardian era attached and semi-detached terrace houses. Since the 1950's as a result of gentrification many of these properties have been renovated. In 1968 the announced acquisition by the Housing Commission of Victorian of a block of houses on an area bounded by Lygon, Princes, Lee and Drummond Street (the "Lee Street block" became the trigger for the formation of the Carlton Association in March 1969. Following the placement of a Black Ban on the site by a number of trade unions (including the Builders Labourers Federation) and a strong public relations and lobbying campaign by the resident action group the Carlton Association were successful in seeing the site saved by 1973, with a number of the properties heritage listed by the National Trust. Parts of Carlton North's housing also came under threat during the 1970's as a result of the Housing Commissions 'urban renewal' program as well as plans to construct the F19 Freeway through the suburb, however the activities of the Carlton Association, trade unions and other community activists prevented this from occurring. Today large parts of the suburb are now covered by various heritage overlays.
