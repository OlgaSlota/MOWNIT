Eugene Kwan 03:47, 14 November 2005 (UTC) Panther (legendary creature)[edit] Regarding your questions about this page, I've found a good reference site and rewritten the article. Its still a stub, but I believe, much improved. Let me know what you think if you would be so kind. :-) Stephen Day 04:10, 4 November 2006 (UTC) Thanks for responding. To answer your question, yes I got the images off of other websites, but in all three cases they are of works (and in the Raglan Castle case a photo) that are more than 100 years old -- as far as I know. So, there shouldn't be a problem as far as I can see in using them. Stephen Day 23:40, 8 November 2006 (UTC) Trivia[edit] Hi. I just read your thoughts on trivia and I was wondering if you would be interested in this. Here is a wikiproject proposal for trivia and a fresh look at trivia policy by the admins. Support the wikiproject proposal. Add your name to the list here: [wiki project proposal for wikitrivia] Please send this link to other users that you feel would be interested.
