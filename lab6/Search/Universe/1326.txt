Contents 1 About 2 Article Topic Proposal 3 Sources for Topic 4 Article Edit Summary About[edit] Junior Sociology major with concentrations in HR Management and Women's and Gender Studies at Drake University I am enrolled in Global Youth Studies and I am excited to learn more about and participate in the Wikipedian Community! Article Topic Proposal[edit] The topic that I am proposing is music and global hybridity. Through my research, this topic could potentially move into two separate directions. The first direction could be more about how genres of music have impacted the pop culture around the world. The second direction that this could form into would be about youth music subcultures with a focus on the Global South. I would like to find as many sources as possible to be able to separate the two directions and eventually choose just one of the directions for my article. This topic is important to bringing a Global North bias out of Wikipedia by adding in examples of how youth culture across the world can shape a genre or culture of music. Through my browsing within Wikipedia itself, I found that every youth subculture article dealing with music was a phenomena in the Global North. The problem with the list of subcultures is that it makes the Global South youth look like they do not listen to music or that they only listen to specifically Global North musical artists. Youth around the world listen to music in some form and people should be able to learn more about the musical habits across the world. I still do not have an exact proposal of my new article, but once I can decide on an article title, the process will move a little more quickly. As of now, for my lead paragraph I would like to explain hybridity as it pertains to music and then preface the examples I will discuss later in the article. I would like to incorporate sources I have found about Muslim youth music culture and hip-hop in different countries across Africa no matter what direction the article goes in. If the article takes the specific Global South subcultures route, I would link in the list of subcultures. Again, at this point, my goal is to gather as many sources as possible to really narrow down this vast topic's proposal.

My edit is not extensive yet, but I am using my sources to explain the global side of popular music. It also explains how it is difficult to label something as popular music or not. I touched on the connection between World music and being labeled as an "exotic other." I chose a couple of genres of music that are popular in different countries to explain how something may be popular in one context, but not another. The edit also discusses how the digitization of music has impacted the popular music field by allowing artists to become famous through social media. I am still not totally confident with my edit because it is very short at this point and I am nervous that I am trying to discuss different genres too in depth. I am also nervous that I am trying to make an argument out of this article because I am discussing the different countries' popular music genres. The sandbox for my edit is located here!
