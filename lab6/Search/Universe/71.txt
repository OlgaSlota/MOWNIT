This was an enormous county, including the northern part of New York State as well as all of the present State of Vermont and, in theory, extending westward to the Pacific Ocean. This county was reduced in size on July 3, 1766 by the creation of Cumberland County, and further on March 16, 1770 by the creation of Gloucester County, both containing territory now in Vermont. On March 12, 1772, what was left of Albany County was split into three parts, one remaining under the name Albany County. One of the other pieces, Tryon County, contained the western portion (and thus, since no western boundary was specified, theoretically still extended west to the Pacific). The eastern boundary of Tryon County was approximately five miles west of the present city of Schenectady, and the county included the western part of the Adirondack Mountains and the area west of the West Branch of the Delaware River. The area then designated as Tryon County now includes 37 counties of New York State. The county was named for William Tryon, colonial governor of New York. In the years prior to 1776, most of the Loyalists in Tryon County fled to Canada. In 1784, following the peace treaty that ended the American Revolutionary War, the name of Tryon County was changed to Montgomery County in order to honor the general, Richard Montgomery, who had captured several places in Canada and died attempting to capture the city of Quebec, replacing the name of the hated British governor. In 1789, Ontario County was split off from Montgomery. The actual area split off from Montgomery County was much larger than the present county, also including the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Orleans, Steuben, Wyoming, Yates, and part of Schuyler and Wayne counties. Genesee County was created by a splitting of Ontario County in 1802. This was much larger than the present Genesee County, however. It contained the present Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Niagara, Orleans, Wyoming, and portions of Livingston and Monroe counties. Finally, Monroe County was formed from parts of Genesee and Ontario counties in 1821. Geography[edit] According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,367 square miles (3,540 km2), of which 657 square miles (1,700 km2) is land and 710 square miles (1,800 km2) (52%) is water.[5] Monroe County is in the northern tier of western New York State, northeast of Buffalo and northwest of Syracuse. The northern county line is also the state line and the border of the United States, marked by Lake Ontario. Monroe County is north of the Finger Lakes.

(August 2008) Monroe County was chartered as a municipal corporation by the New York State Legislature in 1892[6] and re-chartered under New York's Municipal Home Rule Law in 1965.[7] Executive branch[edit] The county's executive branch is headed by the County Executive, Cheryl Dinolfo.[8] The executive's office is located on the first floor of the County Office Building on West Main Street in Rochester. The county was exclusively governed by a Board of Supervisors for the first 114 years of its history. In 1935, the position of County Manager, appointed by the Board, was approved by popular referendum.[9] In 1983, the position was replaced by a County Executive, directly elected by popular vote, with expanded powers (e.g., veto).[10] In 1993, the legislature enacted term limits for the executive office of 12 consecutive years to start in 1996.[11] Legislative branch[edit] The county's legislative branch consists of a 29-member County Legislature which replaced the earlier 43-member Board of Supervisors on January 1, 1967.[12] It meets in the Legislative Chambers on the fourth floor of the County Office Building. All 29 members of the legislature are elected from districts. District Maps Currently, there are 18 Republicans and 11 Democrats. In 1993, the legislature enacted term limits of 10 consecutive years to start in 1996.[13] Judicial branch[edit] Monroe County Court Monroe County Family Court, for matters involving children Monroe County Surrogates Court, for matters involving the deceased Rochester City Court Representation at the federal level[edit] After redistricting based on the 2010 United States Census, Monroe County was split between two congressional districts: District Areas of Monroe County Congressperson Party First took office Residence New York's 25th congressional district All of Monroe County except those portions represented by the 27th district[14] Louise M.

The 4th Division of the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division Economy[edit] Monroe County is a home to a number of international businesses, including Eastman Kodak,[29] Bausch & Lomb,[30] Paychex,[31] and Pictometry International,[32] all of which make Monroe County world headquarters. Xerox, while no longer headquartered in Rochester, has its principal offices and manufacturing facilities in Monroe County.[citation needed] Monroe County is also home to regional businesses such as Wegmans,[33] Roberts Communications, Inc.,[34] PAETEC Holding Corp.,[35] and major fashion label Hickey Freeman.[36] High technology[edit] Further information: Tech Valley Tech Valley, the technologically recognized area of eastern New York State, has spawned a western offshoot into the Rochester, Monroe County, and Finger Lakes areas of New York State. Since the 2000s, as the more established companies in Rochester downsized, the economy of Rochester and Monroe County has been redirected toward high technology, with new, smaller companies providing the seed capital necessary for business foundation. The Rochester and Monroe County area is important in the field of photographic processing and imaging as well as incubating an increasingly diverse high technology sphere encompassing STEM fields, in part the result of private startup enterprises collaborating with major academic institutions, including the University of Rochester and Cornell University.[37] Given the high prevalence of imaging and optical science among the industry and the universities, Rochester is known as the world capital of imaging. The Institute of Optics of the University of Rochester and the Rochester Institute of Technology in nearby Henrietta both have imaging programs.[38] In 2006, the University of Rochester became the largest employer in the Rochester area, surpassing the Eastman Kodak Company.[39] Demographics[edit] Historical population Census Pop. %± 1830 49,855 — 1840 64,902 30.2% 1850 87,650 35.0% 1860 100,648 14.8% 1870 117,868 17.1% 1880 144,903 22.9% 1890 189,586 30.8% 1900 217,854 14.9% 1910 283,212 30.0% 1920 352,034 24.3% 1930 423,881 20.4% 1940 438,230 3.4% 1950 487,632 11.3% 1960 586,387 20.3% 1970 711,917 21.4% 1980 702,238 −1.4% 1990 713,968 1.7% 2000 735,343 3.0% 2010 744,344 1.2% Est. 2014 749,857 [40] 0.7% U.S. Decennial Census[41] 1790-1960[42] 1900-1990[43] 1990-2000[44] 2010-2013[2] As of the census of 2000, there were 735,343 people, 286,512 households, and 184,513 families residing in the county.
