List of Internet top-level domains - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia List of Internet top-level domains From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search Parts of this article (those related to New TLDs: http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/delegated-strings) are outdated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (March 2014) This list of Internet top-level domain extensions contains all top-level domains, which are those domains in the DNS root zone of the Domain Name System of the Internet. The official list of all top-level domains is maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).[1] IANA also oversees the approval process for new proposed top-level domains. As of January 2016[update], the root domain contains 1205 top-level domains,[2] while a few have been retired and are no longer functional.

Though originally intended for use by for-profit business entities, for a number of reasons it became the "main" TLD for domain names and is currently used by all types of entities including nonprofits, schools, and private individuals. Domain name registrations may be successfully challenged if the holder cannot prove an outside relation justifying reservation of the name, to prevent "squatting". It was originally administered by the United States Department of Defense. Yes Yes .org organization Public Interest Registry This is an open TLD; any person or entity is permitted to register. Originally intended for use by non-profit organizations, and still primarily used by some. Yes Yes .net network Verisign This is an open TLD; any person or entity is permitted to register.

No No .edu U.S. higher education Educause (via Verisign) The .edu TLD is limited to specific higher educational institutions such as, but not limited to, trade schools and universities. In the U.S., its use was restricted in 2001 to post-secondary institutions accredited by an agency on the list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies maintained by the United States Department of Education. This domain is therefore almost exclusively used by American colleges and universities. Some institutions, such as the Exploratorium, that do not meet the current registration criteria have grandfathered domain names. No Yes .gov U.S. national and state government agencies General Services Administration (via Verisign) The .gov TLD is limited to United States governmental entities and agencies as well as qualifying state, county and local municipal government agencies.
