Most often, business entities are formed to sell a product or a service. There are many types of business entities defined in the legal systems of various countries. These include corporations, cooperatives, partnerships, sole traders, limited liability company and other specifically permitted and labelled types of entities. The specific rules vary by country and by state or province. Some of these types are listed below, by country. For guidance, approximate equivalents in the company law of English-speaking countries are given in most cases,for e.g. ≈ public limited company (UK, Ireland and the Commonwealth) ≈ Ltd. (UK, Ireland and the Commonwealth) ≈ limited partnership, = Unlimited partnership = Chartered company = Statutory company = Holding company = Subsidiary company = One man company = NGOs However, the regulations governing particular types of entity, even those described as roughly equivalent, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. When creating or restructuring a business, the legal responsibilities will depend on the type of business entity chosen.[1] Contents 1 Albania 2 Argentina 3 Australia 4 Austria 5 Belarus 6 Belgium 7 Bosnia and Herzegovina 8 Brazil 9 Brunei 10 Bulgaria 11 Cambodia 12 Canada 13 Chile 14 China 15 Colombia 16 Croatia 17 Czech Republic 18 Denmark 19 Dominican Republic 20 Ecuador 21 Egypt 22 Estonia 23 European Economic Area (including the European Union) 24 Finland 25 France 26 Germany 27 Greece 28 Guatemala 29 Haiti 30 Hong Kong 31 Hungary 32 Iceland 33 India 34 Indonesia 35 Iran 36 Ireland 37 Israel 38 Italy 39 Japan 40 Jordan 41 Kazakhstan 42 Korea, North 43 Korea, South 44 Latvia 45 Lebanon 46 Lithuania 47 Luxembourg 48 Macedonia 49 Malaysia 50 Mexico 51 Mongolia 52 Namibia 53 Nepal 54 Netherlands 55 New Zealand 56 Nicaragua 57 Nigeria 58 Norway 59 Oman 60 Pakistan 61 Peru 62 Philippines 63 Poland 64 Portugal 65 Romania 66 Russia 67 Saudi Arabia 68 Serbia 69 Singapore 70 Slovakia 71 Slovenia 72 South Africa 73 Spain 74 Sweden 75 Switzerland 76 Taiwan 77 Thailand 78 Turkey 79 Tunisia 80 Ukraine 81 United Kingdom 82 United States 82.1 Federally incorporated 82.2 State, Territory or Commonwealth incorporated 82.2.1 Partnerships 82.2.2 Limited Liability Companies 82.2.3 Corporations 83 Uzbekistan 84 Vietnam 85 See also 86 References 87 External links Albania[edit] Sh.A.

Unlimited liability corporations can be formed in Alberta "AULC" and Nova Scotia "NSULC". The word or expression "Limited", Limitée, "Incorporated", Incorporée, "Corporation" or Société par actions de régime fédéral or the corresponding abbreviation "Ltd.", Ltée, "Inc.", "Corp." or S.A.R.F. forms part of the name of every entity incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act (R.S., 1985, c. C-44). ≈ Ltd. or Plc (UK) As an exception, entities registered prior to 1985 may continue to be designated Société commerciale canadienne or by the abbreviation S.C.C. Under the Canada Cooperatives Act (1998, c. 1), a co-operative must have the word "cooperative", "co-operative", "coop", "co-op", coopérative, "united" or "pool", or another grammatical form of any of those words, as part of its name. Unlike in many other Western countries, Canadian businesses generally only have one form of incorporation available. The aforementioned AULC and NSULC are generally not used as operating business structures, but are instead used to create favorable tax positions for either Americans investing in Canada or vice versa.[7] Rather, Canadian businesses are generally formed under one of the following structures: SP (Sole Proprietorship): No formal business structure is established GP (General Partnership): Either a formal structure with a partnership agreement, or an informal structure, in which case the Partnerships Act for the province will apply LP (Limited Partnership): An investment structure, limiting both the liability and the participation of the investor.

Requires an authorized minimum share capital of £50,000;[47] of which it must have allotted shares to the value of at least £50,000 and a minimum of 25% must be fully paid up prior to starting business. Private company limited by guarantee. Such a company must include Limited or Ltd. at the end of its name (so cannot readily be distinguished from a private company limited by shares), unless it cannot distribute its profits. Guarantee companies are commonly used by not for profit organizations, which may omit Ltd. at the end of their names. Unlimited company (or Welsh Anghyfyngedig). A company either with or without a share capital whose members or shareholders do not benefit from limited liability should the company ever go into formal liquidation. It is not a requirement under company law to add or state the word or designation Unlimited or its abbreviations (Unltd., or Ultd.) at the ending of its legal company name, and most unlimited companies do not. Unlimited companies are exempted from filing accounts with the Registrar of Companies for public disclosure, subject to a few exceptions (unless the company was a qualified subsidiary or a parent of a limited company during the accounting period). Sole proprietorship (Sole traders) United States[edit] In the United States, the individual states incorporate most businesses. Very few special types are incorporated by the federal government. For federal tax purposes, the Internal Revenue Service has separate entity classification rules. Under the tax rules, an entity may be classified as a corporation, a partnership, a Cooperative or a disregarded entity. A corporation may be either a Subchapter S corporation or a C corporation. A disregarded entity has one owner (or a married couple as owner) that is not recognized for tax purposes as an entity separate from its owner. Types of disregarded entities include single-member LLCs; qualified subchapter S subsidiaries and qualified real estate investment trust subsidiaries. A disregarded entity's transparent tax status does not affect its status under state law. For example, for federal tax purposes, a sole-member LLC (SMLLC) is disregarded, so that all its assets and liabilities are treated as owned by its single member. But under state law, an SMLLC can contract in its own name and its owner is generally not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the entity.[48] To be recognized as a Cooperative for tax purposes Cooperatives must follow certain rules under Sub Chapter T of the Internal Revenue Code.[49] Federally incorporated[edit] The key word for a bank is "national". A bank chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) must have the word "national" in its name. A bank chartered by a state cannot have "national" in its name. For a savings bank (formerly called a savings and loan association) or credit union, the key word is "federal," and the same rules apply; a federally chartered savings bank or credit union must have the word "federal" in its name, while a state chartered savings bank or credit union cannot have "federal" in its name. NA (National Association), a designation used by banks chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) NT&SA (National Trust and Savings Association), a less common designation used by national banks Federal Credit Union, chartered by the National Credit Union Association (NCUA) Federal Savings Bank, formerly called federal savings and loan association Many federal governmental units are specially formed public corporations, while some private organizations have received a charter from Congress. State, Territory or Commonwealth incorporated[edit] See also: United States corporate law The following are the main business designations and types: Sole proprietorship: a business consisting of a single owner (which may itself be a business entity), not in a separately recognized business form. Partnerships[edit] General Partnership: is a partnership in which all the partners are jointly and separately liable for the debts of the partnership. In most U.S. states, it can be created by agreement without requiring a public filing. The partners may themselves be legal entities or individuals. LP Limited Partnership: a partnership where at least one partner (the general partner, which may itself be an entity or an individual) has unlimited liability for the LP's debts) and one or more partners (the limited partners) have limited liability (which means that they are not responsible for the LP's debts beyond the amount they agreed to invest). Limited partners generally do not participate in the management of the entity or its business. LLP Limited Liability Partnership: a partnership where a partner's liability for the debts of the partnership is limited except in the case of liability for acts of professional negligence or malpractice. In some states, LLPs may only be formed for purposes of practicing a licensed profession, typically attorneys, accountants and architects. This is often the only form of limited partnership allowed for law firms (as opposed to general partnerships). LLLP Limited Liability Limited Partnership: a combination of LP and LLP, available in some states. Limited Liability Companies[edit] LLC, LC, Ltd. Co. Limited Liability Company: a form of business whose owners enjoy limited liability, but which is not a corporation. Allowable abbreviations vary by state. Note that in some states Ltd. by itself is not a valid abbreviation for an LLC, because in some states (e.g. Texas), it may denote a corporation instead. See also Series LLC. For U.S. federal tax purposes, in general, an LLC with two or more members is treated as a partnership, and an LLC with one member is treated as a sole proprietorship. PLLC Professional Limited Liability Company: some states do not allow certain professionals to form an LLC that would limit the liability that results from the services the professionals provide such as doctors, medical care; lawyers, legal advice; and accountants, accounting services; architects, architectural services; when the company formed offers the services of the professionals. Instead those states allow a PLLC or in the LLC statutes, the liability limitation only applies to the business side, such as creditors of the company, as opposed to the client/customer service side, the level of medical care, legal services, or accounting provided to clients. This is meant to maintain the higher ethical standards that these professionals have committed themselves to by becoming licensed in their profession and to prevent them from being immune (or at least limit their immunity) to malpractice suits. Corporations[edit] Corp., Inc. Corporation, Incorporated: used to denote corporations (public or otherwise). These are the only terms universally accepted by all 51 corporation chartering jurisdictions in the United States. However, in some states other suffixes may be used to identify a corporation, such as Ltd., Co./Company, or the Italian term S.p.A. (in Connecticut; see under Italy). Some states that allow the use of "Company" prohibit the use of "and Company", "and Co.", "& Company" or "& Co.". In most states sole proprietorships and partnerships may register a fictitious "doing business as" name with the word "Company" in it. For a full list of allowed designations by state, see the table below. Professional corporation abbreviated as PC or P.C. are those corporate entities for which many corporation statutes make special provision, regulating the use of the corporate form by licensed professionals such as attorneys, architects, accountants, and doctors. Doing Business As: denotes a business name used by a person or entity that is different from the person's or entity's true name. DBAs are not separate entities and do not shield the person or entity who uses the DBA as a business name from liability for debts or lawsuits. Filing requiments vary and are not permitted for some types of businesses or professional practices. See also Delaware corporation, Nevada corporation, Massachusetts business trust.
