There is also a substantial number of Welsh speakers in the Patagonia area of Argentina. Some people speak Celtic languages in the other Celtic diaspora areas of the United States,[6] Canada, Australia,[7] and New Zealand.[8] In all these areas, the Celtic languages are now only spoken by minorities though there are continuing efforts at revitalisation. Welsh is the only Celtic language not classified as "endangered" by UNESCO. During the 1st millennium BC, they were spoken across much of Europe, in the Iberian Peninsula, from the Atlantic and North Sea coastlines, up to the Rhine valley and down the Danube valley to the Black Sea, the northern Balkan Peninsula and in central Asia Minor. The spread to Cape Breton and Patagonia occurred in modern times.

These are the Gaelic languages (i.e. the Irish language and Scottish Gaelic - both descended from Old Irish), and the Brittonic languages (i.e. Welsh and the Breton language - both descended from Old Brittonic). The other two, Cornish and Manx, were spoken into modern times but later died as spoken community languages.[9][10][11] For both these languages, however, revitalisation movements have led to the adoption of these languages by adults and children and produced some native speakers.[12][13] Taken together, there were roughly one million native speakers of Celtic languages as of the 2000s.[14] In 2010, there were more than 1.4 million speakers of Celtic languages.[15] Demographics[edit] Language Native name Grouping Number of native speakers Number of people who have one or more skills in the language Main area(s) in which the language is spoken Regulated by/language body Estimated Number of Speakers in Major Cities Welsh Cymraeg Brittonic 562,000 (19.0% of the population of Wales) self-certify that they "can speak Welsh" (2011)[16][17] Around 947,700 (2011) total speakers — Wales: 788,000 speakers, 26.7% of the population of Wales,[16][17] — England: 150,000[18] — Chubut Province, Argentina: 5,000[19] — United States: 2,500[20] — Canada: 2,200[21] Wales; Y Wladfa, Chubut — Welsh Language Commissioner (Meri Huws) — The Welsh Government (previously the Welsh Language Board Bwrdd yr Iaith Gymraeg) Cardiff: 54,504 Swansea: 45,085 Newport: 18,490[22] Irish Gaeilge Goidelic 40,000–80,000[23][24][25][26] In the Republic of Ireland, 94,000 people use Irish daily outside the education system.[27] 1,887,437 Republic of Ireland: 1,774,437[27] United Kingdom: 95,000 United States: 18,000 Ireland Foras na Gaeilge Dublin: 184,140 Galway: 37,614 Cork: 57,318[28] Belfast: 30,360[29] Breton Brezhoneg Brittonic 206,000 356,000[30] Brittany Ofis Publik ar Brezhoneg Rennes: 7,000 Brest: 40,000 Nantes: 4,000[31] Scottish Gaelic Gàidhlig Goidelic 57,375 (2011)[32] in Scotland as well as 1,275 (2011) in Nova Scotia[33] 87,056 (2011)[32] in Scotland Scotland Bòrd na Gàidhlig Glasgow: 5,726 Edinburgh: 3,220[34] Aberdeen: 1,397[35] Cornish Kernewek Brittonic 600[36] 3,000[37] Cornwall Keskowethyans an Taves Kernewek Truro: 118[38] Manx Gaelg Goidelic 100+,[12][39] including a small number of children who are new native speakers[40] 1,823[41] Isle of Man Coonceil ny Gaelgey Douglas: 507[42] Mixed languages[edit] Shelta, based largely on Irish with influence from an undocumented source (some 86,000 speakers in 2009).[43] Some forms of Welsh-Romani or Kååle also combined Romany itself with Welsh language and English language forms (extinct).[44] Beurla-reagaird, Highland travellers language Classification[edit] Classification of Indo-European languages. (click to enlarge) Celtic divided into various branches: Lepontic, the oldest attested Celtic language (from the 6th century BC).[45] Anciently spoken in Switzerland and in Northern-Central Italy, from the Alps to Umbria. Coins with Lepontic inscriptions have been found in Noricum and Gallia Narbonensis.[46][47][48][49] Celtiberian, anciently spoken in the Iberian peninsula,[50] in parts of modern Aragón, Old Castile, and New Castile in Spain. The relationship of Celtiberian with Gallaecian, in the northwest of the peninsula, is uncertain.[51][52] Gallaecian, anciently spoken in the former Gallaecia, northwest of the peninsula (modern Galicia, Asturias, northern Portugal and parts of modern Old Castile).[53] Gaulish languages, including Galatian and possibly Noric. These languages were once spoken in a wide arc from Belgium to Turkey. They are now all extinct. Brittonic, including the living languages Breton, Cornish, and Welsh, and the extinct languages Cumbric and Pictish though Pictish may be a sister language rather than a daughter of Common Brittonic.[54] Before the arrival of Scotti on the Isle of Man in the 9th century, there may have been a Brittonic language in the Isle of Man. Goidelic, including the living languages Irish, Manx, and Scottish Gaelic. Scholarly handling of the Celtic languages has been rather argumentative owing to scarceness of primary source data. Some scholars (such as Cowgill 1975; McCone 1991, 1992; and Schrijver 1995) distinguish Continental Celtic and Insular Celtic, arguing that the differences between the Goidelic and Brittonic languages arose after these split off from the Continental Celtic languages. Other scholars (such as Schmidt 1988) distinguish between P-Celtic and Q-Celtic, putting most of the Gaulish and Brittonic languages in the former group and the Goidelic and Celtiberian languages in the latter. The P-Celtic languages (also called Gallo-Brittonic) are sometimes seen (for example by Koch 1992) as a central innovating area as opposed to the more conservative peripheral Q-Celtic languages. The Breton language is Brittonic, not Gaulish, though there may be some input from the latter,[55] having been introduced from Southwestern regions of Britain in the post-Roman era and having evolved into Breton – still partially intelligible by modern Welsh and Cornish speakers. In the P/Q classification schema, the first language to split off from Proto-Celtic was Gaelic. It has characteristics that some scholars see as archaic, but others see as also being in the Brittonic languages (see Schmidt). In the Insular/Continental classification schema, the split of the former into Gaelic and Brittonic is seen as being late. The distinction of Celtic into these four sub-families most likely occurred about 900 BC according to Gray and Atkinson[56][57] but, because of estimation uncertainty, it could be any time between 1200 and 800 BC. However, they only considered Gaelic and Brythonic. The controversial paper by Forster and Toth[58] included Gaulish and put the break-up much earlier at 3200 BC ± 1500 years. They support the Insular Celtic hypothesis. The early Celts were commonly associated with the archaeological Urnfield culture, the Hallstatt culture, and the La Tène culture, though the earlier assumption of association between language and culture is now considered to be less strong.[59][60] The Celtic nations, where Celtic languages are spoken today, or were spoken into the modern era:   Ireland (Irish)   Scotland (Scottish Gaelic)   Isle of Man (Manx)   Wales (Welsh)   Cornwall (Cornish)   Brittany (Breton) There are legitimate scholarly arguments in favour of both the Insular Celtic hypothesis and the P-Celtic/Q-Celtic hypothesis. Proponents of each schema dispute the accuracy and usefulness of the other's categories. However, since the 1970s the division into Insular and Continental Celtic has become the more widely held view (Cowgill 1975; McCone 1991, 1992; Schrijver 1995), but in the middle of the 1980s, the P-Celtic/Q-Celtic hypothesis found new supporters (Lambert 1994), because of the inscription on the Larzac piece of lead (1983), the analysis of which reveals another common phonetical innovation -nm- > -nu (Gaelic ainm / Gaulish anuana, Old Welsh enuein "names"), that is less accidental than only one. The discovery of a third common innovation, would allow the specialists to come to the conclusion of a Gallo-Brittonic dialect (Schmidt 1986; Fleuriot 1986). The interpretation of this and further evidence is still quite contested, and the main argument in favour of Insular Celtic is connected with the development of the verbal morphology and the syntax in Irish and British Celtic, which Schumacher regards as convincing, while he considers the P-Celtic/Q-Celtic division unimportant and treats Gallo-Brittonic as an outdated hypothesis.[45] Stifter affirms that the Gallo-Brittonic view is "out of favour" in the scholarly community as of 2008 and the Insular Celtic hypothesis "widely accepted".[61] When referring only to the modern Celtic languages, since no Continental Celtic language has living descendants, "Q-Celtic" is equivalent to "Goidelic" and "P-Celtic" is equivalent to "Brittonic". Within the Indo-European family, the Celtic languages have sometimes been placed with the Italic languages in a common Italo-Celtic subfamily, a hypothesis that is now largely discarded, in favour of the assumption of language contact between pre-Celtic and pre-Italic communities.[citation needed] How the family tree of the Celtic languages is ordered depends on which hypothesis is used: "Insular Celtic hypothesis" Proto-Celtic Celtiberian (Continental Celtic) Gaulish (Continental Celtic) Insular Celtic Brittonic Goidelic "P-Celtic hypothesis" Proto-Celtic Celtiberian (Q-Celtic) Goidelic (Q-Celtic) P-Celtic Gaulish Brittonic Eska (2010)[edit] Eska (2010)[62] evaluates the evidence as supporting the following tree, based on shared innovations, though it is not always clear that the innovations are not areal features. It seems likely that Celtiberian split off before Cisalpine Celtic, but the evidence for this is not robust. On the other hand, the unity of Gaulish, Goidelic, and Brittonic is reasonably secure. Schumacher (2004, p. 86) had already cautiously considered this grouping to be likely genetic, based, among others, on the shared reformation of the sentence-initial, fully inflecting relative pronoun *i̯os, *i̯ā, *i̯od into an uninflected enclitic particle. Eska sees Cisalpine Gaulish as more akin to Lepontic than to Transalpine Gaulish. Celtic Celtiberian ("Hispano-Celtic") Nuclear Celtic? Cisalpine Celtic: Lepontic → Cisalpine Gaulish Transalpine–Goidelic–Brittonic (secure) Transalpine Gaulish ("Transalpine Celtic") Insular Celtic Goidelic Brittonic Eska considers a division of Transalpine–Goidelic–Brittonic into Transalpine and Insular Celtic to be most probable because of the greater number of innovations in Insular Celtic than in P-Celtic, and because the Insular Celtic languages were probably not in great enough contact for those innovations to spread as part of a sprachbund. However, if they have another explanation (such as an SOV substratum language), then it is possible that P-Celtic is a valid clade, and the top branching would be: Transalpine–Goidelic–Brittonic (P-Celtic hypothesis) Goidelic Gallo-Brittonic Transalpine Gaulish ("Transalpine Celtic") Brittonic Characteristics[edit] This section may be too technical for most readers to understand.

Possible Celtic languages[edit] It has been suggested that several poorly-documented languages may possibly have been Celtic. Camunic is an extinct language which was spoken in the first millennium BC in the Valcamonica and Valtellina valleys of the Central Alps. It has most recently been proposed to be a Celtic language.[63] Ligurian was spoken in Northern Mediterranean Coast straddling South-east French and North-west Italian coasts, including parts of Tuscany, Elba island and Corsica. Xavier Delamarre argues that Ligurian was a Celtic language, similar to, but not the same as Gaulish.[64] The Ligurian-Celtic question is also discussed by Barruol (1999). Ancient Ligurian is either listed as Celtic (epigraphic),[65] or Para-Celtic (onomastic).[47] Lusitanian was spoken in the area between the Douro and Tagus rivers of western Iberia (a region straddling the present border of Portugal and Spain). It is known from only five inscriptions and various place names.[66] It is an Indo-European language and some scholars have proposed that it may be a para-Celtic language, which evolved alongside Celtic and/or formed a dialect continuum or sprachbund with Tartessian and Gallaecian. This is tied to a theory of an Iberian origin for the Celtic languages.[66][67][68] It is also possible that the Q-Celtic languages alone, including Goidelic, originated in western Iberia (a theory that was first put forward by Edward Lhuyd in 1707) and/or shared a common linguistic ancestor with Lusitanian.[69] Secondary evidence for this hypothesis has been found in research by biological scientist, who have identified (firstly) deep-rooted similarities in human DNA found precisely in both the former Lusitania and Ireland,[70][71] and; (secondly) the so-called "Lusitanian distribution" of animals and plants unique to western Iberia and Ireland. Both of these phenomena are now generally believed to have resulted from human emigration from Iberia to Ireland, during the late Paleolithic or early Mesolithic eras.[72] Other scholars, see greater linguistic affinities between Lusitanian, proto-Italic and Old European.[73][74] Pictish was for a long time thought to be a pre-Celtic, non-Indo-European language of Scotland. Some believe it was an Insular Celtic language allied to the P-Celtic language Brittonic (descendants Welsh, Cornish, Cumbric, Breton).[75] Rhaetian was spoken in central parts of present-day Switzerland, Tyrol in Austria, and the Alpine regions of northeastern Italy. It is documented by a limited number of short inscriptions (found through Northern Italy and Western Austria) in two variants of the Etruscan alphabet. Its linguistic categorization is not clearly established, and it presents a confusing mixture of what appear to be Etruscan, Indo-European, and uncertain other elements. Howard Hayes Scullard argues that Rhaetian was also a Celtic language.[76] Tartessian, spoken in the south-west of the Iberia Peninsula.[77] Tartessian is known by 95 inscriptions with the longest having 82 readable signs.[67][78][79] John T. Koch argues that Tartessian was also a Celtic language.[79] See also[edit] Celts Celts (modern) A Swadesh list of the modern Celtic languages Celtic Congress Celtic League (political organisation) Continental Celtic languages Italo-Celtic Language families and languages Notes[edit] ^ Nordhoff, Sebastian; Hammarström, Harald; Forkel, Robert; Haspelmath, Martin, eds.

This corpus contains some linguistic features that are clearly Celtic and others that in our opinion are not Celtic. The former we shall group, for the moment, under the label northwestern Hispano-Celtic. The latter are the same features found in well-documented contemporary inscriptions in the region occupied by the Lusitanians, and therefore belonging to the variety known as LUSITANIAN, or more broadly as GALLO-LUSITANIAN. As we have already said, we do not consider this variety to belong to the Celtic language family." Jordán Colera 2007: p.750 ^ Kenneth H. Jackson suggested that there were two Pictish languages, a pre-Indo-European one and a Pritenic Celtic one. This has been challenged by some scholars.
