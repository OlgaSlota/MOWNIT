Different name?[edit] Is it true that a portion of a business has to go by a different name for it to be regarded as a division? The examples given (HP's division versus the Compaq subsidiary) seem to contradict that. JanCeuleers (talk) 08:33, 1 February 2008 (UTC) No, and perhaps this should be clarified. If you have "A, Incorporated" and it has a department called the "Q Printers" that sells printers, and "X Scanners" that sells scanners, you would have the Q Printers division and X Scanners division of A Incorporated. If A incorporated had purchased all the stock of Q Printers, Inc., then it would be Q Printers subsidiary. A subsidiary is a separate, wholly owned entity; a division is a part of a business that is not a separate entity. Paul Robinson (Rfc1394) (talk) 23:25, 22 January 2011 (UTC) One can have a customer service division. A mainframe division, a research division, a sales division. All sorts of reasons for having divisions. And they need not have any special separate names. Dmcq (talk) 12:03, 29 December 2011 (UTC) This article is just original research. Unless some sources can be found I think it should just be deleted. Dmcq (talk) 12:11, 29 December 2011 (UTC) InterWiki mistakes?[edit] The German interwiki de:Abteilung (Organisation) tells me something different about a "division". The german article rather means "a bunch of jobs with a leader/supervisor", there's a division-leader etc. and thats just a "team" ... not a lot of people - on the contrary i think, the english article means: a out sourced sector of the business, not legally etc. thats right, but a hole big part - that means, divisions like: marketing, distribution, research ... but i'm really not sure about that ... i was just wondering, what a "division" in this article-meaning "consists" of? In german there is a division/abteilung made of certain Stellen - there seems to be no pendant to this in english... regards --WissensDürster (talk) 12:48, 21 July 2009 (UTC) PS: It is the equivalent of a corporation or limited liability company obtaining a fictitious name or "doing business as" certificate and operating a business under that fictitious name de.wiki has an article on de:Doing business as, and if the Doing business as-article is equivalent to this one here, it really not equivalent to de:Abteilung (Organisation). An "abteilung" don't has an other name... more hints: an "abteilung" has a de:Abteilungsleiter (= "head of department") and is one of several "organization units". Maybe that's all because germans often "made theories up". There are no interwiki possibilites for de:Ablauforganisation, de:Primärorganisation, de:Sekundärorganisation, de:Stelle (Organisation), too ... de:Einliniensystem, de:Mehrliniensystem and de:Stablinienorganisation are also sometimes asked in a couple of forums, but no one can give a adequate translation ... ;) --WissensDürster (talk) 12:57, 21 July 2009 (UTC) Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Division_(business)&oldid=468256938" Categories: Stub-Class WikiProject Business articles Top-importance WikiProject Business articles WikiProject Business articles needing attention WikiProject Business articles Navigation menu Personal tools Not logged in Talk Contributions Create account Log in Namespaces Article Talk Variants Views Read Edit New section View history More Search Navigation Main page Contents Featured content Current events Random article Donate to Wikipedia Wikipedia store Interaction Help About Wikipedia Community portal Recent changes Contact page Tools What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Permanent link Page information Print/export Create a book Download as PDF Printable version Languages This page was last modified on 29 December 2011, at 12:11.
