Infix notation - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Infix notation From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search Prefix notation ("Polish") Infix notation Postfix notation ("Reverse Polish") v t e Infix notation is the notation commonly used in arithmetical and logical formulae and statements. It is characterized by the placement of operators between operands – "infixed operators" – such as the plus sign in "2 + 2". Contents 1 Usage 2 Order of operations 3 Further notations 4 See also 5 References 6 External links Usage[edit] Infix notation is more difficult to parse by computers than prefix notation ( e.g. + 2 2 ) or postfix notation ( e.g. 2 2 + ). However many programming languages use it due to its familiarity. It is more used in arithmetic, e.g. 2+2, 5×6.[1] Order of operations[edit] In infix notation, unlike in prefix or postfix notations, parentheses surrounding groups of operands and operators are necessary to indicate the intended order in which operations are to be performed. In the absence of parentheses, certain precedence rules determine the order of operations. Further notations[edit] Infix notation may also be distinguished from function notation, where the name of a function suggests a particular operation, and its arguments are the operands. An example of such a function notation would be S(1,3) in which the function S denotes addition: S(1,3) = 1+3 = 4. See also[edit] Tree traversal: Infix (In-order) is also a tree traversal order. It is described in a more detailed manner on this page.
