David Kernow 18:11, 26 June 2006 (UTC) Support per other Département articles. joturner 18:21, 26 June 2006 (UTC) Oppose Plurality is not a reason for moving a page. However, I would support a move to Département of France as it sounds more correct. joturner 18:18, 26 June 2006 (UTC) Support. john k 20:17, 26 June 2006 (UTC) Support--Aldux 22:49, 26 June 2006 (UTC) Support - Kiwipete 09:21, 28 June 2006 (UTC) Consensus[edit] As a result of the consensus reached above, the page was moved on 1 July 2006 by User:El C. Kiwipete 08:51, 19 July 2006 (UTC) (How to edit?)[edit] Wondering how to edit the "départements" entries? The Wikipedia:WikiProject French departements standards might help. Disambiguation[edit] The following departements will need disambiguation: Cher Var (and maybe others) Any thoughts on how to do this? Eg: Cher (departement) Cher (France) 3 See WikiProject French departements. Cher (département) and Var (département) appear to have been dismbiguated. AdamMorton 02:39, 15 April 2006 (UTC) Standard presentation for population, area, prefecture & ss.pref.: (ideas needed: rough idea on Hauts-de-Seine) See also Wikipedia:WikiProject French departements - User:Olivier From the article: "Reorganisations of the Paris region and the division of Corsica have added a further seven". I make it 6: one in corsica, and 91 - 95 in Paris. -- Tarquin, Monday, June 24, 2002 Can we identify which departements belong in which regions? -- Zoe There is 6 overseas départements (DOM) not 4 as suggest the article. 62.212.103.37 20:39 Sep 16, 2002 (UTC) See edit to the article. 4 DOM, 3 TOM + other collectivites. - User:Olivier Here is an interesting link (in French): 1999 census, including population of regions, departements and cities of more 100,000 inhabitants. Caution: "Aires urbaines de plus de 50,000 habitants" doesn't give the population of the cities, but the population of the "urban area", the city and its surroundings. http://www.dgcl.interieur.gouv.fr/publications/CL_en_chiffres/CL2001_ch01.pdf - User:Olivier Does anyone have a useable source for maps of individual départements? RickK 04:05, 4 Sep 2003 (UTC) Aesthetics[edit] Just my opinion, but I find that blue-and-pink "This article is part of the series..." box at top right of this article visually unappealing and off-putting. Don't such messages, in any case, belong at the bottom of the article, and can't this particular one be much better designed? -- Picapica 21:26, 23 Mar 2005 (UTC) Another referenece[edit] Here is an explination of French local governement I wrote a few years ago: http://www.business-in-europe.com/gb/regions/regions_explained.htm Former Departments[edit] Can the former Corsican departments be separated/unlinked from the current ones? - signed by anon IP Nope, Corsica was once a singular department until 1974 I believe, split into two halves and the numeral designation "20" was abandoned. There is no numeral designation "96" but the proposal to make the island of Mayotte an overseas department in 2011 might inherit the number. Saintes Pierre et Moquelon are territorial collectivities, a higher stage above an department, and other territorial collectivities are Wallis et Futuna, New Caledonia and French Polynesia. The French republic wants to grant the overseas territories of the South Pacific a much higher degree of autonomy, alike a British Commonwealth nation or similar to how the Danish crown just granted "country status" to Greenland and the Faeroe Islands. + 71.102.2.206 (talk) 09:39, 3 July 2009 (UTC) Proposing move[edit] Hello all- I made a proposal regarding this article that may be of interest to you: Wikipedia:Requested_moves#13_October_2006. -Eric (talk) 18:35, 13 October 2006 (UTC) It was requested that this article be renamed but the procedure outlined at WP:RM#How to request a page move did not appear to be followed, and consensus could not be determined. Please request a move again with proper procedure if there is still a desire for the page to be moved. Thank you for your time! -- tariqabjotu 09:39, 14 October 2006 (UTC) Take 2 is below, this time after reading all the instructions. -Eric (talk) 14:25, 14 October 2006 (UTC) Requested move[edit] The following is a closed discussion of the proposal. Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made in a new section on the talk page. No further edits should be made to this section. The result of the proposal was Move to Departments of France. Duja 07:56, 20 October 2006 (UTC) Départements of France → Department (France) — The English word "department" includes as one of its meanings the French word "département." The en Wikipedia should not be attempting to have a French language entry for a common French term that has long-established equivalent in the English language. In keeping with what I think is standard Wikipedia procedure for disambiguating terms, the format for this kind of article title should be: <English_term (specific_use)>. If this proposal is accepted, the en article Département should redirect to the proposed new page, and a link to the new page should be placed on the disambiguation page Department. -Eric (talk) 14:25, 14 October 2006 (UTC) Survey[edit] Add  * '''Support'''  or  * '''Oppose'''  on a new line followed by a brief explanation, then sign your opinion using ~~~~. Support = policy. Agathoclea 14:53, 14 October 2006 (UTC) Support. no reason to use the French form when the English form is generally what is used in, er, English. I would prefer Departments of France, however, as I think this article is as much about the departments as a group as it is about the individual function of a department. john k 16:01, 14 October 2006 (UTC) Support, and I agree with John — Departments of France, like Counties of England, Cantons of Switzerland, etc. Proteus (Talk) 16:23, 14 October 2006 (UTC) Support, but would prefer Departments of France. And if this is successful, perhaps we could take a look at Régions of France? Bolivian Unicyclist 18:03, 14 October 2006 (UTC) Equivocal. Essentially, the previous three supporters simply suggest redirecting Départements of France to Departments of France, rather than vice versa as at present. Is it worth making a lot of work just for that? The article Department has a link to Département which then has links to various countries' departments, and I think that generally works well. Kiwipete 00:28, 15 October 2006 (UTC) Discussion[edit] Add any additional comments: If the page is moved, are you going to go through all the articles on all the départements and all cities and towns and arondissements -- basically every geographical article of France -- and change every instance of département to "department"? For instance: Located in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur région, Nice is a commune and the préfecture (administrative capital) of the Alpes-Maritimes département. (-from article Nice) This is similar to the dozen or so articles I just spot-checked. How far will you take anglicization? --SigPig 06:43, 15 October 2006 (UTC) There are also many instances of the English word in en Wikipedia articles about France. If we follow my suggestion in the reason for move, any links pointing to the page Département would automatically re-direct to the new page "Department (France)"/"Departments of France." In any case, as I said above, the word exists in English and means what it means in French, so it should be used in English-language articles. That sentence in the Nice article should read: "...Nice is a commune and the prefecture (administrative capital) of the department <of> Alpes-Maritimes." Note that prefectureis also an English word. -Eric (talk) 14:53, 15 October 2006 (UTC) The above discussion is preserved as an archive of the proposal. Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made in a new section on this talk page. No further edits should be made to this section. Orientation[edit] I like the way this article provides references to US and English counties to provide orientation.--Dmz5 17:13, 7 December 2006 (UTC) Single use flag templates[edit] According to User:Andrwsc/Obsolete country data templates, the following flag templates are currently used only in Departments of France: Template:Country data Aachen (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Electorate of Bavaria (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Bremen (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Archbishopric of Cologne (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Dutch Republic (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Free Imperial City (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Republic of Genoa (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Hamburg (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Electorate of Hanover (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Duchy of Holstein (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Bishopric of Liège (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Lübeck (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Archbishopric of Mainz (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Bishopric of Münster (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Austrian Netherlands (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Duchy of Oldenburg (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Electorate of the Palatinate (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Papal States (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Duchy of Parma and Piacenza (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Kingdom of Prussia (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data République des Sept Dizains (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Kingdom of Spain (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Old Swiss Confederacy (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Archbishopric of Trier (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Grand Duchy of Tuscany (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) Template:Country data Republic of Venice (edit | talk | history | links | watch | logs) We are in the process of a bit of a consolidation of the flag templates and I would like to ask, if the article writers on this article here would agree if I would replace the calls of the above listed templates on this article here with their direct expansion. This would mean I would replace for example {{flagcountry|Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg}} with [[Image:Lueneburg.jpg|22x20px|Flag of Brunswick-Lüneburg]] [[Brunswick-Lüneburg|Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg]]. User:Andrwsc expressed the concern that it is a bit overkill to have flag templates for these uncommon "countrys" to use them on a single article. If there no objections, I would do this and then delete the flag templates listed above. Thanks. --Ligulem 12:56, 17 February 2007 (UTC) I've expanded the flag template calls in the table under "Napoleonic Empire" [1]. If there aren't any complaints, I will delete the now unused country data templates listed above. --Ligulem 18:10, 20 February 2007 (UTC) Bourbon restoration[edit] Was the departmental system retained by Louis XVIII and Charles X, or did they try to bring back the old provinces? 68.40.65.164 22:38, 20 June 2007 (UTC) It did remain. No change back to the old provinces. 90.52.191.129 (talk) 21:34, 16 December 2008 (UTC) Vehicle plates[edit] Found something that needs to be updated: The départements are numbered: their two-digit numbers appear in postal codes, in INSEE codes (including "social security numbers") and on vehicle number-plates, though this last usage will mostly disappear with a new car plate scheme due for 2006. Well? Was the "scheme" (is that the right word to be using?) implemented? Funnyhat 05:18, 12 August 2007 (UTC) Map[edit] At first glance of the map I thought the numbers in the table below corresponded to the map, however this is not the case and it may be worthwhile including the numbers in the table in a seperate column. unfortunatly I have no idea which department matches which number so this may require someone which knows more about french geography/local goverment. Waacstats (talk) 10:56, 18 March 2008 (UTC) Hi- If you are referring to the departments map and list on the article page, it looks to me like they are all correct (i.e. the numbers on the department polygons in the map correspond to the ones in the table, and have the correct names next to them). -Eric talk 17:15, 18 March 2008 (UTC) Image copyright problem with Image:ReunionFlag.gif[edit] The image Image:ReunionFlag.gif is used in this article under a claim of fair use, but it does not have an adequate explanation for why it meets the requirements for such images when used here. In particular, for each page the image is used on, it must have an explanation linking to that page which explains why it needs to be used on that page. Please check That there is a non-free use rationale on the image's description page for the use in this article. That this article is linked to from the image description page. This is an automated notice by FairuseBot. For assistance on the image use policy, see Wikipedia:Media copyright questions. --07:20, 2 October 2008 (UTC) Explanation of table[edit] In the table, what do the flags next to the prefecture represent? 216.36.132.66 (talk) 13:33, 4 September 2009 (UTC) Interesting question ;D it's the flag of the région. Imho, it has nothing to do here, one can think that it is the flag of the préfecture and wonders why there are so numerous identical flags. It would be better to have a column région, with the flag and the name of the region... it would allow to sort on région column, to show all the départements in each région. But the table would be too big, imho. At the present, I think it would be better to remove these flags before the préfectures. Alvar☮ ☎ 14:26, 4 September 2009 (UTC) I've put a new column for the region, I think that solves the problem. Random user 8384993 (talk) 12:24, 5 September 2009 (UTC) Thanks. Alvar☮ ☎ 14:49, 5 September 2009 (UTC) Translation Tag[edit] The section "The Future" is a translation of part of the French article. (RJPe (talk) 19:53, 22 October 2009 (UTC)) Also, this same section includes the a pair of sentences relating to automobile tags (Since April 2009, a departmental number is still included but it is now one chosen by the vehicle owner and not necessarily the place of residence. Also, the number of the department is automatically accompanied on the number plate by the logo of the region in which the department lies.) that are totally unconnected to the rest of the section. If this material should remain, it needs to be better integrated. --Khajidha (talk) 19:58, 4 April 2011 (UTC) reasons for creating system[edit] the article states that one of the ideas for creating the department structure was "directly inspired by the Great Terror, during which the government had lost control of many rural areas which were far from any centre of government". Yet the Terror took place three years after the creation of departments. Can anyone clarify this? The Thieving Gypsy (talk) 23:06, 26 December 2010 (UTC) Coat of arms/ Blasons[edit] Why put blasons that have no official values ( and some where invented during the XXe century )and not put official logos for departments? Those coat of arms have no meaning for french people, and most have never seen them. Nicolas 12:47, 21 July 2011 (UTC) Comment in Main Text[edit] It appears that a comment (Please expand this table ...) by someone has slipped into the text of note 1 of table 7. If I am correct, it should be deleted; I'm not going to do it myself because I'm unfamiliar with the long history of this article. (The comment has been present for at least the last 18 months.) SDCHS (talk) 09:35, 26 December 2011 (UTC) English meaning[edit] Department doesn't mean a French département, even though the words are similar. It needs to be left in the French. This is similar to the inappropriate use in English of commune and deputy which don't mean the same as their close French counterpart-words. Those words need also to be left in French because they lack English equivalents. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 80.189.103.145 (talk) 18:55, 14 July 2012 (UTC) The English equivalent would be County and the plural Counties. So yes I agree that Department is incorrect and recommend a move. Regards, Sun Creator (talk) 10:43, 9 August 2012 (UTC) Utter nonsense. "département" has been translated into English as "department" for over two hundred years now. It has never been translated as "county." "Deputy" and "Commune" are likewise used in English. john k (talk) 12:24, 9 August 2012 (UTC) Here's some definitions, from the World English Dictionary on dictionary.reference.com: Department: territorial and administrative division in several countries, such as France Commune: the smallest administrative division in France, Italy, Switzerland, etc., governed by a mayor assisted by a municipal council. Deputy: a member of the legislative assembly or of the lower chamber of the legislature in various countries, such as France Please give this nonsense up. These are long-used and well-understood English translations of the French terms. john k (talk) 12:28, 9 August 2012 (UTC) Levels of Government[edit] It says the department: is one of the three levels of government below the national level, between the region and the commune. But what about the arrondissements and the cantons, which come below the department but above the commune? 98.221.131.228 (talk) 09:23, 28 March 2013 (UTC) Wrong map[edit] This is another issue which should be added to the box. There are no hyphens in the names on the map. --2.245.138.153 (talk) 00:31, 18 September 2015 (UTC) Are you referring to a map in the article? If so, which one? There are many. Hyphens where? In place names? Eric talk 12:44, 18 September 2015 (UTC) In this map, the hyphens are indeed absent. The official spelling includes hyphens (e.g. Saône-et-Loire, and as a matter of fact, the respective wiki articles are hyphened). As a matter of legibility, I'd guess it is better to omit them in this map. The same map has another issue : Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon is shown as a departement, which it ceased to be in 1985, as noted elswhere in the article. Herix (talk) 01:42, 14 March 2016 (UTC) Weser department[edit] I do not have the talent for wiki-table-manipulation needed to add it, so instead I come to the talk page. As far as I can make out, the short-lived Weser department (de) (1807-1810) needs adding to the list of former departments. If someone does that, I might even translate the German wiki entry to create an equivalent for english wikipedia. Though if someone else were to get in first I should not weep. Either way, although there is a French language entry (Département du Weser) (fr), at the time of writing it really only amounts to a sub-stub. (Which might be another challenge for someone reading this?) Of course, maybe it's already in the nice table ... somewhere, and I'm just not very observant - don't think so, though! Regards Charles01 (talk) 12:18, 10 January 2016 (UTC) It looks to me like it was a department of the Napoleonic Kingdom of Westphalia. PatGallacher (talk) 14:02, 10 January 2016 (UTC) Ah, yes. I see what you mean. Cancel that request. (But do we have an entry, yet, on Departments of the Kingdom of Westphalia)? Regards Charles01 (talk) 14:42, 10 January 2016 (UTC) Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Departments_of_France&oldid=709947684" Categories: C-Class France articles High-importance France articles Pages translated from French Wikipedia Hidden categories: Interlanguage link template link number Navigation menu Personal tools Not logged in Talk Contributions Create account Log in Namespaces Article Talk Variants Views Read Edit New section View history More Search Navigation Main page Contents Featured content Current events Random article Donate to Wikipedia Wikipedia store Interaction Help About Wikipedia Community portal Recent changes Contact page Tools What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Permanent link Page information Print/export Create a book Download as PDF Printable version Languages This page was last modified on 14 March 2016, at 01:42.
