Achaean Doric Greek - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Achaean Doric Greek From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search Not to be confused with Achaean Greek, an alternative name for the Mycenaean Greek and civilization.[1][2] Achaean Doric Greek may refer to: Contents 1 Doric of Achaea 2 Achaean Doric Koine 3 References 4 Sources Doric of Achaea[edit] The Doric Greek dialect spoken in Achaea in the NW Peloponnese, on the islands of Cephalonia and Zakynthos in the Ionian Sea and in the Achaean colonies of Magna Graecia in Southern Italy (including Sybaris and Crotone). This strict Doric dialect was later subject to the influence of mild Doric spoken in Corinthia. It survived to 350 BC.[3] According to Hesychius Achaeans means the Greeks but foremost those inhabiting part of the Peloponnese, called Achaea[4] and gives these words under the ethnic Achaeans: kairoteron <καιρότερον>· ἐνωρότερον. Ἀχαιοί Greek enôroteron earlier (kairos time, enôros early cf. Horae) kephalides Ἀχαιοί δέ κεφαλίδας for standard Greek korsai κόρσαι sideburns (kephalides was also an alternative for epalxeis 'bastions' in Greek proper) sialis <σιαλίς>· βλέννος. Ἀχαιοί Greek blennos (cf. blennorrhea) slime, mud. (Greek sialon or sielon saliva, modern Greek σάλιο salio) Achaean Doric Koine[edit] Achaean Doric Koine. The common dialect, used in the decrees of the Achaean League. In Arcadia it can be traced very easily because it differs considerably from the old non-Doric Arcadian (see Arcadocypriot Greek). In Achaea itself it helds its ground until the 1st century BC. The Achaean Doric Koine did not develop the extreme features that are typical of the Aegean Doric and North-West Doric Koine.
