The journal's editors-in-chief are Andrew King, Sarah Neal (both University of Surrey), Karim Murji, Sophie Watson, and Kath Woodward (all Open University). Sociology is regarded as one of the three "main sociology journals in Britain," along with the The Sociological Review and the British Journal of Sociology.[1] The journal was established in 1967 as "the clearest intellectual representative of the social aspirations of the Butskellite era,"[2] with Michael Banton serving as its first editor. It was formerly published by Cambridge University Press and has been published by Sage Publications since 2002. Shortly after its establishment, it became the official journal of the British Sociological Association, replacing the British Journal of Sociology.[3] Contents 1 Abstracting and indexing 2 Former editors 3 Notable articles 4 References 5 External links Abstracting and indexing[edit] Sociology is abstracted and indexed in Scopus and the Social Sciences Citation Index.
