Naval Intelligence Division Agency overview Formed 1882 Preceding agency Foreign Intelligence Committee Dissolved 1964 Superseding agency Defence Intelligence Jurisdiction Government of the United Kingdom Headquarters Admiralty Building Whitehall London Parent agency Admiralty The Naval Intelligence Division (NID) was the intelligence arm of the British Admiralty before the establishment of a unified Defence Intelligence Staff in 1965. It dealt with matters concerning British naval plans, with the collection of naval intelligence. It was also known as "Room 39", after its room number at the Admiralty.[1] Contents 1 History 1.1 World War I 1.2 World War II 2 Geographical section 3 Amalgamation 4 Directors of Naval Intelligence 5 See also 6 References 7 Sources 8 External links History[edit] The Foreign Intelligence Committee was established in 1882[2] and it evolved into the Naval Intelligence Department in 1887.[3] The NID staff were originally responsible for fleet mobilisation and war plans as well as foreign intelligence collection; thus in the beginning there were originally two divisions: (1) intelligence (Foreign) and (2) Mobilisation. In 1900 another division, War, was added to deal with issues of strategy and defence, and in 1902 a fourth division, Trade, was created for matters related to the protection of merchant shipping. The Trade Division was abolished in October 1909 in the wake of the Committee of Imperial Defence inquiry into the feud between the First Sea Lord, Admiral Sir John Fisher and former Commander-in-Chief Channel Fleet, Admiral Lord Charles Beresford, when it was discovered that the captain heading the Trade Division had been supplying the latter with confidential information during the inquiry.[4] In 1910, the NID was shorn of its responsibility for war planning and strategy when the outgoing Fisher created the Navy War Council as a stop-gap remedy to criticisms emanating from the Beresford Inquiry that the Navy needed a naval staff—a role the NID had been in fact fulfilling since at least 1900, if not earlier. After this reorganisation, war planning and strategic matters were transferred to the newly created Naval Mobilisation Department and the NID reverted to the position it held prior to 1887—an intelligence collection and collation organisation.[5] World War I[edit] During World War I the NID was responsible for the Royal Navy's highly successful cryptographic efforts, Room 40.[6] World War II[edit] Naval Ultra messages were handled differently from Army and Air Force Ultra because the Admiralty was an operational HQ and could give orders during a battle; while the Imperial General Staff (Army) and Air Staff would give commanders general orders such as, "clear the enemy out of Africa" without telling them how to do it. Hence verbatim translations of naval decodes were sent by Hut 4 to the NID and nowhere else (except for some naval intelligence sent directly from Bletchley Park to Commanders-in-Chief in the Mediterranean).[7] Hut 8 which decrypted Enigma messages for Hut 4 to translate and analyse had less information for Ultra as the Kriegsmarine operated Enigma more securely than the German Army and Air Force. Hut 4 also broke various hand cyphers and some Italian naval traffic.[8] The NID also initiated the 30th Assault Unit whose role was information gathering, reconnaissance and sabotage. Members of the unit, including Ralph Izzard, are acknowledged as inspirations for Ian Fleming (who also worked for the NID) in the creation of his fictional spy, James Bond.[9] Geographical section[edit] The Geographical Section of the Naval Intelligence Division, Naval Staff, Admiralty, produced a series of Geographical Handbooks from 1917-1922 to provide information for the British Armed Forces. The Naval Intelligence Division Geographical Handbook Series was produced between 1941 and 1946 to provide information for the British Armed Forces.[10] Amalgamation[edit] In 1965, the three service intelligence departments were amalgamated in the new Defence Intelligence Service at the Ministry of Defence.[11] Directors of Naval Intelligence[edit] Directors of Naval Intelligence included:[12] Captain William Henry Hall, 1887–1889 Rear-Admiral Cyprian Bridge, 1889–1894 Rear-Admiral Lewis Beaumont, 1895–1899 Rear-Admiral Reginald Custance, 1899–1902 Rear-Admiral Prince Louis of Battenberg, 1902–1905 Captain Charles Ottley, 1905–1907 Rear-Admiral Sir Edmond Slade, 1907–1909 Rear-Admiral Alexander Bethell, 1909–1912 Captain Thomas Jackson, 1912–1913 Rear-Admiral Henry Oliver, 1913–1914 Rear-Admiral Sir Reginald 'Blinker' Hall, 1914–1919 Rear-Admiral Hugh 'Quex' Sinclair, 1919–1921 Rear-Admiral Maurice Fitzmaurice, 1921–1924 Rear-Admiral Alan Hotham, 1924–1927 Rear-Admiral William Fisher (Acting), 1926–1927 Rear-Admiral Barry Domvile, 1927–1930 Rear-Admiral Cecil Usborne, 1930–1932 Rear-Admiral Gerald Dickens, 1932–1935 Vice-Admiral James Troup, 1935–1939 Vice-Admiral John Godfrey, 1939–1942 Rear-Admiral Edmund Rushbrooke, 1942–1946 Vice-Admiral Edward Parry, 1946–1948 Rear-Admiral Eric Longley-Cook, 1948–1951 Rear-Admiral Sir Anthony Buzzard, 1951–1954 Vice-Admiral Sir John Inglis, 1954–1960 Vice-Admiral Sir Norman Denning, 1960–1964 Rear-Admiral Patrick Graham, 1964–1965 See also[edit] Ian Fleming, who worked as a personal assistant to DNI then Captain John Godfrey Ralph Izzard Author, adventurer, journalist, NID officer, member of the 30 Assault Unit and noted as an inspiration for James Bond.[9] Merlin Minshall, who worked for Fleming in the NID, participated in several operations and has been claimed as one of the inspirations for James Bond.
