One billion can also be written as b or bn. In scientific notation, it is written as 1 × 109. Previously in British English (but not in American English), the word "billion" referred exclusively to a million millions (1,000,000,000,000). However, this is no longer as common as earlier, and the word has been used to mean one thousand million (1,000,000,000) for some time.[2][3] The alternative term "one thousand million" is rare[citation needed] and is used primarily to ease understanding among both native and non-native speakers of English to clarify relative comparative understanding[clarification needed] of the term, as many other languages use words similar to "billion" (e.g. Spanish billón, or Finnish biljoona) to mean one trillion (1,000,000,000,000 or a million millions). In the South Asian numbering system, it is known as 100 crore or 1 Arab. The term milliard can also be used to refer to 1,000,000,000; whereas "milliard" is seldom used in English, variations on this name often appear in other languages (e.g. Hungarian (Magyar) milliárd, Indonesian miliar, Polish miliard, Danish milliard, Spanish millardo, French milliard, Italian miliardo, Icelandic milljarður, German Milliarde, Hebrew מיליארד, Finnish miljardi, Dutch miljard, Croatian milijarda, Serbian милијарда, Bulgarian милиард, Russian миллиард, Czech miliarda, Arabic مليار, Romanian miliard, Swedish miljard, Norwegian milliard, Turkish milyar, Esperanto miliardo). The SI prefix giga indicates 1,000,000,000 times the base unit. Despite this, B remains the common abbreviation for this number.[citation needed] See Orders of magnitude (numbers) for larger numbers; and long and short scales.

About 109 minutes ago, the Roman Empire was flourishing and Christianity was emerging. (109 minutes is roughly 1,900 years.) About 109 hours ago, modern human beings and their ancestors were living in the Stone Age (more precisely, the Middle Paleolithic). (109 hours is roughly 114,000 years.) About 109 days ago, Australopithecus, an ape-like creature related to an ancestor of modern humans, roamed the African savannas. (109 days is roughly 2.7 million years.) About 109 months ago, dinosaurs walked the Earth during the late Cretaceous. (109 months is roughly 82 million years.) About 109 years—a gigaannus—ago, the first multicellular eukaryotes appeared on Earth. It takes approximately 95 years to count from one to one billion in a single sitting.[5] The universe is thought to be about 13.8 × 109 years old.[6] Distance 109 inches is 15,783 miles (25,400 km), more than halfway around the world and thus sufficient to reach any point on the globe from any other point. 109 metres (called a gigameter) is almost three times the distance from the Earth to the Moon. 109 kilometres is over six times the distance from the Earth to the Sun. Finance The possession of assets with total value of 109 United States dollars would place a person among the world's wealthiest individuals. As visualized in a work by artist Michael Marcovici, this amount of money in stacks of hundred-dollar bills can fit on twelve wrapped pallets.[7] Area A billion square inches would be a square about one half mile on a side. A piece of finely woven bed sheet cloth that contained a billion holes would measure about 500 square feet (46 m2), large enough to cover a moderate sized apartment. Volume There are a billion cubic millimeters in a cubic meter. A billion grains of table salt or granulated sugar would occupy a volume of about 2.5 cubic feet (0.071 m3). A billion cubic inches would be a volume comparable to a large commercial building slightly larger than a typical supermarket. Natural landscape A small mountain, slightly larger than Stone Mountain Georgia, United States, would weigh (have a mass of) a billion tons. Count A is a cube; B consists of 1000 cubes of type A, C consists of 1000 Bs; and D consists of 1000 Cs. Thus there are 1 million As in C; and 1,000,000,000 As in D.
