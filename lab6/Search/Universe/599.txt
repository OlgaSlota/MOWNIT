Urban areas of New Zealand - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Urban areas of New Zealand From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   (Redirected from New Zealand urban area) Jump to: navigation, search Statistics New Zealand defines urban areas of New Zealand for statistical purposes (they have no administrative or legal basis).[1] The urban areas comprise cities, towns and other conurbations (an aggregation of urban settlements) of a thousand people or more. In combination, the urban areas of the country constitute New Zealand's urban population.[1] At the 2001 census, the urban population made up 86% of New Zealand's total population. There are three classes of urban area:[1] Main urban areas, with a population of 30,000 or more.[2] These 17 areas mostly correspond to the places known by New Zealanders as cities. Secondary urban areas are the 14 urban areas with a population of 10,000 to 30,000. Minor urban areas make up the remainder of the urban population of the country, towns with 1,000 to 10,000 people. There are 103 minor urban areas. Statistics New Zealand also defines rural centres with a population of 300 to 999 people.[2] While these do not fit the standard international definition of an urban population, they serve to distinguish between true rural dwellers and those in rural settlements or towns. The current placement of urban areas into the three classes is based on populations at the 2013 census, and does not reflect population changes since then. Placements are revised after every census.[1] Contents 1 Description of main urban areas 1.1 North Island 1.2 South Island 2 Description of secondary urban areas 2.1 North Island 2.2 South Island 3 Minor urban areas 3.1 North Island 3.2 South Island 4 Changes to classification 5 See also 6 References Description of main urban areas[edit] The population figures shown are Statistics New Zealand's resident population estimates at the June 2015 estimate.[3] For rankings in various criteria see the ranked list of New Zealand urban areas.
