(January 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The Reverend styles The Most Reverend The Right Reverend The Very Reverend The Reverend v t e The Right Reverend (abbreviations: The Rt Revd; The Rt Rev'd; The Rt Rev.) is a style applied to certain religious figures. In the Anglican Communion[1] and the Roman Catholic Church in Great Britain, it applies to bishops, except that The Most Reverend is used for archbishops (elsewhere, all Roman Catholic bishops are styled as The Most Reverend).[2] In some churches with a Presbyterian heritage, it applies to the current Moderator of the General Assembly, such as the current Moderator of the United Church of Canada the current Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland the current Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. In the Catholic Church, it applies to abbots of monasteries in the Latin Church and archimandrites in the Eastern Catholic Churches. Monsignors of the ranks of protonotary apostolic and domestic prelate were formerly styled The Right Reverend Monsignor, but the currently correct style for them is The Reverend Monsignor. In the Eastern Orthodox tradition, metropolitan bishops are styled "The Right Reverend", provided that they are the primates of autocephalous churches. In Methodism, as in the Anglican tradition, the style is also applied to bishops of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Other Methodist denominations, including the United Methodist Church, only use this to refer to district superintendents, not their bishops.
