Bear flag (gay culture) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Bear flag (gay culture) From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search LGBT symbols             Rainbow flag Bisexual flag Pink triangle Black triangle Labrys Lambda Bear flag Leather flag Transgender flags Intersex flag Asexual flag Safe-space v t e The International Bear Brotherhood Flag was designed to represent the bear subculture within the LGBT community. The colors of the flag are meant to include the colors of the furs of animal bears throughout the world, not necessarily referring to human skin and hair color tones: Dark brown, orange/rust, golden yellow, tan, white, gray, and black. The flag was designed with inclusion in mind.[citation needed] The gay bear culture celebrates secondary sex characteristics such as growth of body hair and facial hair, which is typically considered a "bear" trait.[citation needed] Craig Byrnes created the Bear pride flag in 1995.[1] Byrnes' undergraduate degree in psychology involved designing a senior project about the bear culture that has exploded since the early 1980s, of which he had first-hand experience. He thought it might be fitting to design a flag that would best represent the bear community and include it with the results of his research. Four variations were sewing machine-constructed and Byrnes won approval to display the four 3’×5’ prototype flags at the Chesapeake Bay Bears "Bears of Summer" events in July 1995. The winning design is a field of simple horizontal stripes with a paw print in the upper left corner — a layout familiar to anyone who has seen the Leather Pride flag. The colors represent the fur colors and nationalities of bears throughout the world and was designed with inclusivity in mind. It is trademarked.[2] The International Bear Brotherhood Flag The bear flag flown next to the rainbow flag as an expression of bear and gay pride An Australian version using the bear paw from the Brotherhood flag References[edit] LGBT portal Martins, António (2007-08-04).
