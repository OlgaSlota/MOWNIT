User:Ace Diamond - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia User:Ace Diamond From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search My real name is Tim Sheehan and I teach high school. I'm tempted to type a resume here but... well, I'm not going to. I will note that I am a political scientist by training and an active politician by avocation. I'm currently going to concentrate my attention on the politics entry. Please feel free to comment.Ace Diamond 13:54, 29 Apr 2004 (UTC) This user doesn't use user boxes.
