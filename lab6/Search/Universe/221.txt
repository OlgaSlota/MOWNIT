Oppose This article is already too long. The other article is a stand-alone. Walter Görlitz (talk) 15:23, 21 August 2014 (UTC) Note The software development process article still claims that the merge will go to software development. 
* Oppose There are two distinct topics here. Programming (which you can do alone) and Process. We need a page that managers can come to read, because process is in their domain of expertise.  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 184.71.8.218 (talk) 19:02, 26 February 2015 (UTC) 
 Support I think at 10K this article is actually too short. Its only content is a summary of software development methodology, including the activities and approaches described in (slightly too much) detail there, and a section on the role of marketing in software development. It doesn't make much sense to me to have an overview in this article and then all the details that support that overview in a different article. -- Beland (talk) 16:28, 21 August 2014 (UTC) It also looks to me like the "Subtopic" and "Formal methods" sections of software development process are off-topic for that article and actually belong here. -- Beland (talk) 16:36, 21 August 2014 (UTC) Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Software_development&oldid=648974683" Categories: Start-Class Computing articles Unknown-importance Computing articles All Computing articles Start-Class WikiProject Business articles Unknown-importance WikiProject Business articles WikiProject Business articles Start-Class software articles Start-Class software articles of Unknown-importance Unknown-importance software articles All Software articles Start-Class Systems articles Top-importance Systems articles Systems articles in software engineering WikiProject Systems articles Navigation menu Personal tools Not logged in Talk Contributions Create account Log in Namespaces Article Talk Variants Views Read Edit New section View history More Search Navigation Main page Contents Featured content Current events Random article Donate to Wikipedia Wikipedia store Interaction Help About Wikipedia Community portal Recent changes Contact page Tools What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Permanent link Page information Print/export Create a book Download as PDF Printable version Languages This page was last modified on 26 February 2015, at 19:03.
