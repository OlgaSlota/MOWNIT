Luffy, and Sanji. The One Piece manga and anime series features an extensive cast of characters created by Eiichiro Oda. The series takes place in a fictional universe where vast numbers of pirates, soldiers, revolutionaries, and other adventurers fight each other, using various superhuman and supernatural abilities. The series' storyline follows the adventures of a group of pirates as they search for the series's titular treasure. The main protagonist of the series is Monkey D. Luffy, a young pirate who wishes to succeed Gol D. Roger, the deceased King of the Pirates, by finding his treasure, the "One Piece". During the course of series, Luffy gathers himself a diverse crew, named the Straw Hat Pirates, including the three-swords-wielding Roronoa Zoro, the thief and navigator Nami, the cowardly marksman and inventor Usopp, the cook and martial artist Sanji, the anthropomorphic reindeer and doctor Tony Tony Chopper, the archaeologist Nico Robin, the cyborg shipwright Franky, and the living skeleton musician Brook. Together they sail the seas in pursuit of their dreams, encountering other pirates, bounty hunters, criminal organizations, revolutionaries, secret agents and soldiers of the corrupt World Government, and various other friends and foes. The majority of the characters are human, but the cast also includes, among others, giants, mermen and mermaids, and "fishmen"—beings half human, half fish. Many of the characters possess supernatural abilities gained by eating so called "Devil Fruits". Contents 1 Creation and conception 2 Straw Hat Pirates 2.1 Monkey D.

(September 2008) Several characters have been stated to be based on actual people, such as Eustass Kid (Eustace the Monk and William Kidd), X. Drake (Sir Francis Drake), Basil Hawkins (Basil Ringrose and John Hawkins), Capone "Gang" Bege (Al Capone and William Le Sauvage), Jewelry Bonney (Anne Bonny), Urouge (Aruj), and Scratchmen Apoo (Chui A-poo).[ch. 508] The cross dresser Emporio Ivankov is based on Dr. Frank N. Furter and Norio Imamura. Norio had asked for Oda to draw more okama characters and became Ivankov's first voice actor.[ch. 570] Oda had created Helmeppo before he created Captain Morgan, Helmeppo's father. Oda originally named Morgan after "Chop," with the character's full title being "Naval Captain Chop" or "Sailor Chop". "Sailor" in Japanese is suihei (水兵?), and "Suihei Chop" is a fighting technique used by Giant Baba, a Japanese wrestler. Oda made several versions of Morgan before settling on the final design. After an editor told Oda that Morgan, in Oda's words, "looked lame", Oda changed Morgan's design to his final style.[vol. 1:144 (en)] Straw Hat Pirates[edit] The protagonists of the One Piece series are all the members of the Straw Hat Pirates (麦わらの一味, Mugiwara no Ichimi?), a crew of nine pirates captained by Monkey D. Luffy. The crew's number increases throughout the series, as Luffy recruits new members. Once Usopp joins the Straw Hat Pirates, they gain their own ship, the "Going Merry", which is later destroyed and replaced by a larger and more powerful vessel, the "Thousand Sunny" created by their shipwright Franky. Two years later, the Straw Hats gain a new fleet, called the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, consisting of 5,640 pirates from seven different crews; Luffy objects to the idea of being a fleet commander, and thus organizes his new army in a way that they may act independently, but when one crew is in trouble, the others must do what they can to help them. Monkey D. Luffy[edit] Main article: Monkey D. Luffy Monkey D. Luffy (モンキー・D・ルフィ, Monkī Dī Rufi?) is the primary protagonist of the One Piece series. At the age of seven, he admires and tries to join the pirates of the "Red Haired" Shanks. Ridiculed and rejected, he inadvertently eats their treasure, the Paramecia-type Gum-Gum Fruit (ゴムゴムの実, Gomu Gomu no Mi), which gives his body the properties of rubber. His reckless efforts ultimately lead him into grave peril and cause Shanks to lose an arm while rescuing him. After that, Luffy gives up on joining Shanks. Instead he resolves to start a crew of his own and become King of the Pirates.[ch. 1] Displeased by Shanks thus spoiling his grandson, Garp takes Luffy to be raised by Curly Dadan and her mountain bandits, who he strong-arms into taking him in. During Luffy's time there, he becomes sworn brother with Garp's other ward Ace, and local runaway noble Sabo.[ch. 582–589] Ten years later, and still wearing Shanks' treasured head covering, Luffy forms and captains his own pirate crew called The Straw Hat Pirates and sets sail for the Grand Line and quickly gains infamy as "Straw Hat" Luffy (麦わらのルフィ, Mugiwara no Rufi).[ch. 2, 7, 96, 98] Eventually, after his strength proves insufficient to save Ace from execution, he spends two years on a secluded island, learning the use of the three colors of Haki as well as Gear Fourth from Silvers Rayleigh, before heading to the New World.[ch. 590–602] Luffy is voiced by Mayumi Tanaka.[1] In the 4Kids Entertainment English adaptation, he is voiced by Erica Schroeder.[2] In the Funimation Entertainment English adaptation, his voice is supplied by Colleen Clinkenbeard.[3] Roronoa Zoro[edit] Main article: Roronoa Zoro Roronoa Zoro (ロロノア・ゾロ?, named after François l'Olonnais) is a swordsman who uses up to three swords simultaneously, holding one in each hand and a third in his mouth.[ch. 3, 5, 28] To fulfill a promise to Kuina, his deceased childhood rival, he aims to replace "Hawk Eyes" Mihawk as the world's greatest swordsman.[ch. 5, 50] Traveling the seas in search of Mihawk and making a living as a bounty hunter, he becomes infamously known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro (海賊狩りのゾロ, Kaizoku-Gari no Zoro). Eventually, he comes into conflict with Helmeppo. To keep harm from innocent civilians, Zoro allows himself to be temporarily incarcerated, while Helmeppo plots to have him killed. Zoro is saved from execution by Luffy in exchange for becoming his first crewman. At that point, Zoro makes it clear that he would turn on his captain if he ever stepped between him and his dream.[ch. 2–6] However, Zoro grows fond of his crew and after several defeats in their defense, his priorities change and he convinces Mihawk to take him for a student.[ch. 51f., 485, 597] In the anime television series, his voice actor is Kazuya Nakai.[1] In the 4Kids English adaptation, his name is spelled Roronoa Zolo, and he is voiced by Marc Diraison.[2] In the Funimation English adaptation, his voice is supplied by Christopher R. Sabat.[3] Nami[edit] Main article: Nami (One Piece) Adopted and raised by Navy seaman turned tangerine farmer Bellemere, Nami (ナミ?) and her older sister Nojiko, have to witness their mother being murdered by the infamous Arlong, whose pirate gang occupies their island and extracts tribute from the population. Striking a deal with him, Nami, still a child but already an accomplished cartographer who dreams of drawing a complete map of the world, joins the pirates, hoping to eventually buy freedom for her village. Growing up as a pirate-hating pirate, drawing maps for Arlong and stealing treasure from other pirates, Nami becomes an excellent burglar, pickpocket and navigator with an exceptional ability to forecast weather.[ch. 77, 95, 130] After Arlong betrays her, and he and his gang are defeated by the Straw Hat Pirates, Nami joins the latter in pursuit of her dream and acquires infamy herself as "Cat Burglar" Nami (泥棒猫のナミ, Dorobō Neko no Nami).[ch. 94f., 435] Throughout the series, her weapon of choice is a BO-staff called the clima-tact which can create clouds for offense and defense, such as making thunder clouds or making mirages of herself to confuse her enemies. Usopp[edit] During his early childhood, Usopp (ウソップ, Usoppu?) is abandoned by his father, Yasopp, who leaves to join the Red-Haired Pirates. Then, as Banchina (バンキーナ, Bankīna), his mother, falls ill, Usopp starts telling tall tales, expressing his hope that his father would return and take them out to sea. Even after his mother dies, Usopp does not blame his father for leaving, but strives to become a great pirate himself, despite his cowardly disposition.[ch. 25, 41] He is a gifted inventor, painter and sculptor.[ch. 42, 106, 190] In combat, he primarily relies on slingshots to fire various kinds of ammunition with great precision.[ch. 332] Later on in the series, he achieves Observation Haki, while defending his captain. Eventually, he achieves notoriety under his alter-ego "Sniper King the King of Snipers" (狙撃の王様そげキング, Sogeki no Ō-sama Sogekingu), a hero sniper wearing a golden mask and cape.[ch. 435] In the anime series, his voice actor is Kappei Yamaguchi.[1] Jason Griffith and Sonny Strait provide his voice in the 4Kids and Funimation English adaptations, respectively.[3][4] In a 2007 Oricon poll, Usopp was voted the 10th most wanted character to receive a spin-off amongst all respondents, and the 5th most popular amongst males.[5] In a review of Funimation Entertainment's second DVD release for Mania Entertainment, Bryce Coulter notes that Usopp "brings lots of comic relief to the series", but also comments that he "can be downright annoying at times."[6] Sanji Vinsmoke[edit] While serving as an apprentice cook on a passenger ship, nine-year-old Sanji (サンジ, Sanji?) stands up to a boarding party of pirates led by the infamous "Red Foot" Zeff (赫足のゼフ, Aka-Ashi no Zefu). During the encounter, Sanji is swept into the sea by a massive wave, but Zeff jumps after him because of their common dream of finding the All Blue (オールブルー, Ōru Burū), a legendary sea, containing every kind of fish in the world. While castaway together, the pirate saves Sanji's life yet again by giving him their entire food, surviving himself by eating his own leg. After their eventual rescue, Sanji stays with Zeff for several years and helps him build a floating restaurant, the Baratie (バラティエ). Zeff in turn makes him a first rate cook and teaches him his kick-based fighting style.[ch. 56–59] Mirroring Zeff, Sanji will never refuse a starving person a meal, and in fighting only uses his legs, so as to protect the hands he needs to cook.[ch. 48, 370] He also develops an unusual weakness for women, and makes a principle of never harming one, even if it means his death.[ch. 403] Eventually he becomes infamous under the name of "Black Leg" Sanji (黒脚のサンジ, Kuro Ashi no Sanji),[ch. 435] and while training for a period of two years in Emporio Ivankov's Kamabakka Queendom (カマバッカ王国, Kamabakka Ōkoku), develops the Sky Walk (空中歩行, Sukai Wōku), a variant of the Six Powers (六式, Rokushiki) technique Moonwalk (月歩, Geppō), which allows him to essentially run through air.[ch. 635] Sanji is the first character in One Piece to get a "Wanted Alive Only" poster, for reasons unknown but later reveal he is a member of the Vinsmoke family of assassins. In the Japanese anime television series, he is voiced by Hiroaki Hirata.[7] In the 4Kids English adaptation, he is voiced by David Moo.[8] In the Funimation English adaptation, his voice is supplied by Eric Vale.[3] Tony Tony Chopper[edit] Tony Tony "Cotton Candy Lover"[a] Chopper (トニートニー・チョッパー, Tonī Tonī Choppā?) is a doctor and a blue-nosed reindeer. The power of the Zoan-type Human-Human Fruit (ヒトヒトの実, Hito Hito no Mi) provides him with the ability to transform into a reindeer or a reindeer hybrid.[ch. 140] A self-developed drug he calls Rumble Ball (ランブル・ボール, Ranburu Bōru) enables Chopper to perform even more transformations.[ch. 149] When complimented, Chopper acts really sad while either yelling at the animal who complimented him to stop trying to make him happy, or that Chopper is not very happy.[ch. 140] His voice actress is Ikue Ōtani.[9][10] In the 4Kids and Funimation English adaptations, his voice is supplied by Lisa Ortiz and Brina Palencia, respectively.[11][12] When creating Chopper, Oda wanted a mascot who is both cute and vey weak.[13] An IGN review of the manga praised Chopper's character as one of the best in the series and said that he was able to be both touching and funny.[14] With Chopper's back story, Oda wanted to illustrate that one need not be blood-related to be considered family.[15] Nico Robin[edit] Growing up in Ohara (オハラ?), home of the world's oldest and largest library, Nico Robin (ニコ・ロビン, Niko Robin) becomes an archaeologist at the age of eight.[ch. 391f.] At some point she gains the power of the Paramecia-type Flower-Flower Fruit (ハナハナの実, Hana Hana no Mi), which allows her to have temporary copies of parts of her body, including her eyes and ears, spring up on surfaces near her.[ch. 170] Behind the backs of her teachers, she acquires from them the outlawed knowledge of how to translate the ancient stones called Poneglyph (歴史の本文, Pōnegurifu), which are scattered around the world, and comes to share their goal of finding the illusive Rio Poneglyph (真の歴史の本文, Rio Pōnegurifu), which is said to tell the world's lost history. However, the World Government finds out about these efforts and sends a battlefleet to stop them. Only Robin escapes the devastating attack that claims the lives of the island's entire population, including that of her mother.[ch. 218, 395] Called "Devil Child" (悪魔の子, Akuma no Ko), traumatized and with a bounty on her head, Robin lives a life on the run, unable to trust anyone. To survive, she cooperates with various pirates and other outlaws, until eventually joining forces with Sir Crocodile, leading Baroque Works with him, under the codename "Ms. All-Sunday" (ミス・オールサンデー, Misu Ōrusandē).[ch. 398] After Baroque Works falls apart and without anywhere else to go, she tags along with the Straw Hat Pirates and grows so fond of them that she gives herself up to the Government in order to save them. Only after they find out about her motives and declare open war on her powerful nemesis to get her back, does she come to realize that she has finally found people who will never sell her out, and becomes a part of the crew.[citation needed] In the anime television series, Robin's voice actress is Yuriko Yamaguchi.[16] In the 4Kids English adaptation, her Baroque Works codename was changed to Miss Sunday and she is voiced by Veronica Taylor.[11] In the Funimation English adaptation, her voice is supplied by Stephanie Young.[17] Franky[edit] The son of pirate parents who abandon him at age ten, Cutty Flam (カティ・フラム, Kati Furamu?), nicknamed Franky (フランキー, Furankī), is taken in as an apprentice by a shipwright who secretly holds the plans for a devastating ancient weapon.[ch. 344, 354, 427] Franky's recklessness eventually provides an opportunity to World Government agents seeking these plans.[ch. 356] Attempting to rescue his master, Franky suffers severe injuries and only survives by rebuilding parts of his body using pieces of scrap metal, turning himself into a cola-powered cyborg with super-human strength.[ch. 336, 339, 352, 357f.] After gaining notoriety as "Cyborg" Franky (サイボーグ フランキー, Saibōgu Furankī) and to fulfill his dream of sailing a ship he built around the world, he constructs the Thousand Sunny, a brigantine-rigged sloop-of-war, for the Straw Hat Pirates and joins the crew.[ch. 435–437] In the anime television series, his voice actor is Kazuki Yao.[18] Patrick Seitz provides his voice in the Funimation English adaptation.[19] Brook[edit] Already a pirate before the time of Roger, "Humming" Brook (ブルック, Burukku?) first enters the Grand Line as vice-captain of the music-themed Rumbar Pirates. Leaving their pet, the infant whale Laboon, behind at Reverse Mountain, they promise to return after sailing around the world.[ch. 487] Instead, they are annihilated, with one exception. The power of the Paramecia-type Revive-Revive Fruit (ヨミヨミの実, Yomi Yomi no Mi) allows "Dead Bones" Brook to rise again and live a second life as a skeleton.[ch. 443] Fifty years later, Brook's goal is still to fulfill his late crew's promise and to that end joins the Straw Hat Pirates.[ch. 459][citation needed] Brook is an excellent musician, who says that he can play any instrument, although he is usually seen playing the violin.[ch. 486] He can even influence people with his music to the point of making them fall asleep.[ch. 454] While separated from the other Straw Hats, and incognito as "Soul King" Brook, he gains world fame, filling concert halls with fans.[ch. 600] He is also a skilled fencer, who uses a shikomizue (a Japanese cane sword) in battle.[citation needed] His reduced weight allows him to jump extraordinarily high and to run across water.[ch. 443, 493] And eventually, he learns how to use his devil fruit ability to leave his skeleton body and explore his surroundings as a disembodied soul.[citation needed] He is voiced by Chō.[20] Ian Sinclair provides his voice in the Funimation English adaptation.[21] The idea of a skeleton musician was first conceived by Oda in 2000, about the time of Laboon's introduction and more than half a decade before the first appearance of Brook.[22] Other groups and organizations[edit] Alabasta Kingdom [edit] The Alabasta Kingdom (アラバスタ王国, Arabasuta Oukoku?) is a desert climate island in the Grand Line ruled by Nefeltari Vivi's father, Nefeltari Cobra.[citation needed] The nation's army, the Alabasta Royal Guard, is commanded by Igaram (イガラム, Igaramu?), a man who fights with a saxophone that shoots bullets when played,[citation needed] and guns hidden in his hair that fire when he pulls his neck tie.[citation needed] Next in line after Igaram are Chaka and Pell, dubbed the strongest warrior of Alabasta. Other inhabitants of Alabasta include Vivi's childhood friend and later rebel leader Koza and his father Toh-Toh. The Straw Hats are welcomed here thanks to their help saving the kingdom. Arlong Pirates [edit] The Arlong Pirates (アーロン一味, Āron Ichimi?) are a pirate crew consisting mostly of fishmen led by Arlong and several officers: Kuroobi,[b] a manta ray fishman who uses "Fishman Karate", and Choo,[c] a Japanese whiting fishman, who spits water as if firing bullets, as well as Hatchan and Nami, who leaves the crew following its defeat at the hands of the Straw Hat Pirates.[ch. 69, 75, 93f.] Baroque Works[edit] Baroque Works (バロック・ワークス, Barokku Wākusu?) is a secret organization of more than two thousand members aimed at staging a coup d'état in the Alabasta Kingdom.

His partner, Ms. Valentine (ミス・バレンタイン, Misu Barentain), can change her weight at will.[ch. 111f., 124] Bellamy Pirates [edit] The Bellamy Pirates (ベラミー海賊団, Beramī Kaizokudan?) is a pirate crew originated from the North Blue, and allies with the Donquixote Pirates.

The first mate of the crew is Sarkies (サーキース, Sākīsu), a blue-haired bespectacled man capable of fighting with a giant knife.

Wearing these, he adopted his signature habit of adjusting his constantly slipping glasses by using only the palm of his hand to avoid cutting his face.[ch. 33] Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network praised Kuro as being "both unspeakably cool and utterly vile".[23] Other members of the crew include Jango, and the Meowban Brothers, Siam (シャム, Shamu?) and Butchie (ブチ, Buchi?).

Their Sun insignia was created to cover up the mark of the Celestial Dragon's slave, "Hoof of the Soaring Dragon", since Tiger Fisher bore the mark due to being a slave. But he had escaped the World Nobles and during his escape he freed other mermen/fishmen and Boa Hancock and her two sisters. With the Sun insignia the World Government was unable to claim the slaves due to mass confusion if they were Sun Pirates or not.[ch. 620] Other members include Arlong, Aladdin, Macro, Choo, Kuroobi and Hatchan.

He went on to say, "he never really cared for Buggy", but the Impel Down arc turned him into an "engaging character".[45] He said that he believes that Buggy's being set up as a regular character because he was "afraid he might lose him".[46] Pedro Cortes of Japanator said, "Buggy is always good for a laugh, so his bit was a welcomed respite from the oppressive marines beating down Luffy and the Whitebeard pirates."[47] Caesar Clown[edit] Caesar Clown (シーザー・クラウン, Shīzā Kuraun?) is a navy scientist capable of transforming into gas due to Logia type Gas-Gas Fruit (ガスガスの実, Gasu Gasu no Mi?).

He further notes that, as the characters are "defined by what they seek", there is little room "for actual development".[61] Todd Douglass, Jr. of DVD talk simply states that the series' characters have a lot of charm.[62] His colleague Carl Kimlinger describes the visual style of One Piece as "unconventional" with "grotesquely exaggerated expressions, simple eyes, big mouths and bigger teeth", "supremely ugly supporting characters and skinny, gangly-limbed main cast" and comments that "it's all amazingly distinctive, utterly appropriate, and surprisingly cool—in a goofy kind of way." He also notes that "Funimation's English dub is light-years better than the 4Kids debacle", "unusually accurate, professional, and largely enjoyable, which is far, far more than can be said of the previous dub", but laments that Funimation's version of "Crocodile loses his sepulchral charisma" and that "the original's fine dance on the edge of mawkish sentimentality is disrupted often enough by less-than-stellar acting". He also states that "Colleen Clinkenbeard's Luffy is more a generic spunky kid than a personality in his own right, really coming to life only during the action scenes during which she does a fine job of being darned cool."[63] Dustin Somner of Blu-ray.com comments that the Japanese and Funimation voice-acting is "fairly good, but not exceptional" and sometimes "overly zany".[64] Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD talk notes "the daunting cast of characters, both good and bad" as "one of the appealing factors" of the anime, but also comments that "Some of the voices [of the 4Kids dub] were pretty irritating ... with a lot of high-pitches and over exaggerated speech."[65] Brigitte Schönhense of Splashcomics comments that the "brilliant" (German: "genial") flashbacks into the characters' pasts make them so "likeable and lovable" (German: "sympathisch und liebenswert") and that they are the manga's real strength.[66][67] Mania Entertainment writer Jarred Pine comments that Oda's characters are "whacky" and that his "bizarre" character designs create "wonderful characterizations and personalities". He notes the "well illustrated" facial expressions and says that "it's the whacky characterizations and designs that makes One Piece its own".[68] His colleague Bryce Coulter comments that "One Piece's bizarre character designs will keep your attention as they can be very random and often memorable. Not the prettiest, but it will definitely capture your attention."[6] Notes[edit] ^ わたあめ大好きのチョッパー, Wata-ame Daisuki no Choppā ^ クロオビ, Kuroobi ^ チュウ, Chū ^ 神官, Shinkan ^ サトリ ^ ゲダツ ^ シュラ ^ オーム, Ōmu ^ 神兵, Shinpei ^ ヤマ ^ マントラ, Mantora ^ The Japanese word kaigun (海軍?) translates as navy in English and as marine in French and Dutch, and as Marine in German. ^ The normal Japanese word for "marine", kaiheitai (海兵隊?), is not used in the original. ^ 鷹の目のミホーク, Taka no Me no Mihōku References[edit] One Piece manga[edit] Entire series Oda, Eiichiro.
