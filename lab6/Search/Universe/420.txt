Logic expressed an interest in music as a teenager, and ventured into a musical career in early 2009, releasing a mixtape titled Young, Broke & Infamous, in 2010. He would then sign with Visionary Music Group, before releasing two more mixtapes over two years, which amassed Logic nationwide attention by 2012. Logic went on to release his fourth mixtape Young Sinatra: Welcome to Forever in 2013, to critical acclaim. Following the mixtape, it was announced that Logic secured a recording contract with Def Jam Recordings and his debut studio album Under Pressure was released in October 2014 to critical success. The record was preceded by the single "Under Pressure" and the album debuted at number four on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart; it was later confirmed to have sold more than 171,000 copies by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Logic's second studio album The Incredible True Story was released in November 2015 to critical and commercial success, with critics praising Logic's involvement in the production of the album, his introspective lyricism, and flexibility as a hip hop artist, calling it Logic's best album to date. It was later confirmed to have sold over 185,000 copies in the United States.

Logic spent much of his youth in a collection of public housing projects in West Deer Park, a low-income crime-ridden neighborhood, and, throughout his childhood, both his parents suffered from cocaine addiction and alcoholism.[3] Despite his father initially being absent in his childhood, Logic was able to reconnect with Hall due to his burgeoning rap career. During his early adolescent years, Logic witnessed his brothers produce and distribute crack cocaine to "addicts all over the block,"[4] as well as seeing his siblings sell the drug to his father. Logic maintains that he accurately knows how to manufacture and produce crack cocaine following these experiences.[5] He attended neighboring Gaithersburg High School, however, he did not graduate and was soon expelled after he began skipping classes in the 10th grade. "I started doing badly and failed every class but English, so they kicked me out of school, they gave up on me."[6] After leaving school at 16, Logic decided to actively pursue a musical career. 2005–12: Early career and various mixtapes At the age of 13, Logic met Solomon Taylor, who would soon become his mentor following Logic's expulsion from school. Logic first became interested in rap and hip hop after watching the movie Kill Bill: Volume 1, directed by Quentin Tarantino, that same year. The film's score was completed by RZA of Wu-Tang Clan.[7] Following this, Logic began listening to Wu-Tang Clan, and soon expressed a deep affection for hip hop. Logic bought The Roots album Do You Want More?!!!??!, later that year,[8] which prompted Taylor to bring Logic a large number of CD's containing instrumental beats, for him to write lyrics over.[9] In 2009, Logic performed under the sobriquet "Psychological", with Logic describing the name as: "One name that really stuck was Psychological. I just loved this word because it was about the mind and I knew that's what I wanted my music to consist of; something that really challenges the mind."[10] He released an unofficial mixtape titled Psychological – Logic: The Mixtape under his original stage name. The mixtape allowed Logic to serve as the opening act for artists like Pitbull, EPMD, Method Man, Redman, and Ludacris at various shows all over Maryland. Soon after, he shortened the "Psychological" moniker to "Logic".[10] Following these introductory experiences, Logic released his first official mixtape, Young, Broke & Infamous, on December 27, 2010. The mixtape was well received by critics and allowed Logic to establish an early following. Chris Zarou, the president of Visionary Music Group, heard the mixtape and signed Logic to the independent label. Upon signing, Logic stated in an interview, "Visionary Music Group is like Roc-A-Fella. Damon Dash, that's like Chris Zarou of Visionary Music Group, I like to see myself as a Jay. In no way am I arrogant or cocky, I have to see it in order to do it. They did it independent and when they signed with a major, they did it the way that they wanted to do it."[11] The mixtape was then confirmed to have been downloaded over 250,000 times on online mixtape sharing platform DatPiff. Soon after, Logic released his second mixtape Young Sinatra. It serves as the first installment in the Young Sinatra chronology, and the mixtape received critical acclaim from various publications, including XXL.[8] The music video for "All I Do", released to YouTube, gained over a million views in the week following its release. After the success of his previous two projects, Logic released his third mixtape Young Sinatra: Undeniable on April 30, 2012.[12] The mixtape is notable for Logic addressing various personal topics, including his future, his father's drug use, his aforementioned expulsion from school, and his mother getting stabbed.[13] Speaking about the mixtape, Logic said, "Fans tend to think that if you fall in love with an artist because he makes this kind of sound and then he gets bigger and he grows and he starts to make a different sound, 'He's changing on us.' But with me, I created all types of sounds from the get go, so you can never say I'm changing, you can never say I'm going mainstream or I'm selling out."[12] He commented on the musical aspects of the mixtape, stating, "There's stuff on there for the motherfuckers that don't pay attention to lyrics and just want to have fun, but every line is constructed with such depth that the real lyricists and nitpickers have something to listen to and analyze."[8] After the release of Young Sinatra: Undeniable, Logic completed his first national headlining tour, the Visionary Music Group Tour, alongside then-label-mate Tayyib Ali. 2012–13: Young Sinatra: Welcome to Forever and recording contract Main article: Young Sinatra: Welcome to Forever In early 2013, Logic was again featured in an edition of XXL, being included as a part of the publication's annual "Top 10 Freshmen List", alongside artists such as Trinidad James, Dizzy Wright, Action Bronson, Joey Badass, Ab-Soul, Chief Keef, and Schoolboy Q, among others.[14] Logic soon after completed his first European tour in March 2013, visiting Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, and England, among others. Logic soon confirmed his fourth mixtape Young Sinatra: Welcome to Forever[15] to be released on May 7, 2013.[16] He then also announced his second headlining national tour, the two month-long Welcome to Forever Tour, to promote the project.[17] [18] When released, the mixtape would serve to be another critical success for Logic, with fans and critics alike praising the project, calling it a "free album," as well as noting the rapper's rapid growth and adaptability. The mixtape received over 700,000 downloads on DatPiff.[19] On April 15, 2013, it was announced that Logic had signed with Def Jam Recordings, with esteemed Def Jam producer No I.D. serving as the executive producer of his debut album.[20] Logic released a public statement about the signing, stating, "I'm excited to take this next step in my career. It's incredible for Def Jam [Records] and Visionary Music Group to work together, and the opportunity to collaborate with a living legend like No I.D. is priceless. I'm very humbled to be a part of the most iconic hip hop label of all time."[21] Logic would then go on to tour with Kid Cudi, fellow Def Jam signee Big Sean, and Tyler, the Creator on "The Cud Life Tour 2013" throughout the fall of 2013.[22] 2013–14: Under Pressure Main article: Under Pressure (album) On November 5, Logic revealed that No I.D., former GOOD Music producer Hit-Boy, RattPack member 6ix, and C-Sick would be providing production on his debut record, with No I.D. and 6ix serving as executive producers for the album.[23] On January 27, 2014, Visionary Music Group released the song, "24 Freestyle." The song was released in celebration of Logic's birthday, and serves as the first noted collaboration between all VMG artists.[24] On February 11, Logic had announced that he would be touring alongside EDM band Krewella on the 2014 Verge Campus Spring Tour.[25] On April 8, Logic released "Now," originally scheduled to be featured on his upcoming free EP titled While You Wait. Logic then soon embarked on the month long While You Wait Tour alongside fellow Visionary Music Group member, QuESt.[26][27] On April 22, he released "Alright," the third and penultimate song from the While You Wait project, and features Big Sean.[28] Logic then concluded the four track project, releasing "Finding Forever" on May 7.[29] In summer 2014, Logic announced that no featured artists will appear on his debut album, making it "personal [to Logic] and focused on only me".[30] On August 27, Logic released "Driving Ms. Daisy," featuring Childish Gambino. On September 10, Logic announced the album title, Under Pressure, and also revealed the album's artwork.[31] On September 15, it was announced that the album would be released on October 21.[32] The title track, serving as the album's primary single, was also released on September 15.[33] On October 14, Logic released the second single titled "Buried Alive," which was the final single to be released as promotion for the album.[34] On October 21, Logic released Under Pressure, selling over 70,000 copies in its first week after debuting at #2 on the Billboard Top Hip-Hop/R&B Chart. The LP received worldwide critical acclaim.[35] On November 12, Logic made his network television debut on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, performing "I'm Gone" alongside The Roots, 6ix, and DJ Rhetorik.[36] 2014–present: The Incredible True Story Main article: The Incredible True Story On September 8, Logic released the trailer for his upcoming sophomore album, announcing that the album will be released in the fall of 2015 and is considered a "motion picture sci-fi epic," due to the story told throughout the album. The story, which takes places 100 years into the future, begins with Earth being uninhabitable due to severe human intervention. The primary characters begin traveling to a new planet called "Paradise," and as they travel, they play The Incredible True Story.[37] It features Logic, Steven Blum (as Thomas), Kevin Randolph (as Kai), and Anna Elyse Palchikoff (as Thalia) as main characters, and the cast took part in a panel discussion to promote and talk about the album at New York Comic Con.[38] On September 22, Logic released "Young Jesus," the first single from the album, featuring longtime friend Big Lenbo. "Like Woah" and "Fade Away," the second and third singles from the album, were released on October 14 and November 5, respectively.[39][40] Just over a week later, The Incredible True Story released on November 13, 2015, surpassing his debut album on the Billboard 200, debuting at #3, with a combined first week sales of 135,000. The album also topped the Billboard Top Hip-Hop/R&B Chart. It was also the second Logic commercial release to gain widespread critical acclaim.[41] Logic soon announced The Incredible World Tour, taking place in spring 2016.[42] Soon after the conclusion of The Incredible World Tour, it was revealed that Logic and rapper G-Eazy would be co-headlining The Endless Summer Tour, a nationwide tour, together in summer 2016. Rappers YG and Yo Gotti would be the supporting acts.[43] Personal life In order to properly delve into music as a full-time occupation, Logic terminated a five-year romantic relationship in 2009. He had then stated, "You can put your everything into a relationship, but that doesn't mean you're going to get back what you give. When I created my first mixtape, I realized everything I put in my music — the hours, the lyricism, the time, the grind, pain, sweat, blood, tears — I get it back. I see it."[44] He would then further comment, saying "The thing is, I feel like so many artists, well, not really artists but so many people think they can rap and they just want a deal and the glitz and the glamour and the women but they don't understand that all I do and want to do is rhyme... I think I've sacrificed so much from my relationships to my friendships to my family; I've literally sacrificed my entire life and I'm honest."[8] In October 2015, Logic married Jessica Andrea, a singer and Logic's then girlfriend of three years.[45] Logic has referred to himself as a huge pothead when he was growing up. He has said that, "I don’t drink; I don’t smoke weed. I used to smoke; I used to be a pretty big pothead when I was younger, but I don’t smoke. I might have an occasional glass of champagne." Logic, however, had a serious nicotine addiction, dedicating a song from Under Pressure to talk about the subject. He talks about smoking since he was 13, and that when giving up marijuana and alcohol, he could not muster the courage to give up nicotine. He, however, pledged to not smoke another cigarette concluding the release of Under Pressure.[4] Artistry Influences and rapping technique Despite being a hip-hop artist, Logic is heavily influenced by Frank Sinatra. Sinatra's influence can be seen with many of Logic's persona, with Logic having the "RattPack" (a play on Sinatra's "Rat Pack", and an acronym for "Real All The Time"). The group of friends consists of Logic's manager Chris, producer 6ix, and friend Big Lenbo. He also describes his female fans as BobbySoxers, as well as referring to himself as "Young Sinatra."[46] As a child, his mother made him watch old black and white movies, which formed his love for the singer. Logic cites Sinatra as instrumental to him being able to carry and articulate himself the way he does, with Logic describing him as an individual who "showcased peace, love, grace, positivity, honor, and valor."[11][12] Logic has said that various forms of entertainment across many platforms have influenced him, including A Tribe Called Quest, Outkast, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and films by Quentin Tarantino.[4][47][48] When talking about music in an interview conducted in late 2013, Logic stated, "I love all subgenres within hip-hop and all genres of music and I think that's what allows me to make the music that I do, because of my appreciation for the music".[12] Discography Studio albums List of albums, with selected chart positions Title Album details Peak chart positions Sales US [49] US R&B [50] US Rap [51] US Digital [52] AUS [53] BEL (FL) [54] CAN [55] NZ [56] Under Pressure Released: October 21, 2014 Labels: Visionary Music Group, Def Jam Format: CD, digital download, vinyl 4 2 2 2 79 173 8 26 US: 197,000[57] The Incredible True Story Released: November 13, 2015 Labels: Visionary Music Group, Def Jam Format: CD, digital download, vinyl 3 1 1 3 43 105 7 27 US: 185,000[58] "—" denotes a title that did not chart, or was not released in that territory.
