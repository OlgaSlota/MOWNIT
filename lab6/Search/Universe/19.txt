Demonym - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Demonym From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search Demonym (/ˈdɛmənɪm/; δῆμος dẽmos 'people, tribe', ὄνομα ónoma 'name') is a word to identify residents or natives of a particular place, which is derived from the name of that particular place.[1] It is a recently minted term; previously, gentilic was used by the Oxford English Dictionary. Examples of demonyms include Chinese for a native of China, Swahili for a native of the Swahili coast, American for a native of the United States of America, and in the same way natives of the United Mexican States are referred to as Mexicans. Some groups of people may be referred to by multiple demonyms, relative to their location. For example, the natives of the United Kingdom can be called Brits, British people, or Britons. In English, demonyms are capitalized.[2] In some languages, when a parallel demonym does not exist, people may borrow the denomyn from another language as a nickname or descriptive adjective of a group of people. The term has not been adopted by the Oxford English Dictionary or the Merriam-Webster dictionary.[3] English widely includes country-level demonyms - such as "Ethiopian", "Guatemalan", "Japanese", and "French". But English occasionally includes lower-level demonyms - such as "Seoulite", "Wisconsinite", "Chicagoan", and "Fluminense".[4][5][6] Some large cities such as Australia's Perth, and many other places, lack a commonly used and accepted appellation. This poses a particular challenge to those toponymists who research demonyms. Also, demonyms must be considered a subtype of adjectives and nouns used as appellations.

National Geographic attributes the term "demonym" to Merriam-Webster editor Paul Dickson in a recent work from 1990,[8] however, the word does not appear for nouns, adjectives, and verbs derived from geographical names in the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary nor in prominent style manuals such as the Chicago Manual of Style. It was subsequently popularized in this sense in 1997 by Dickson in his book Labels for Locals.[9] Dickson, however, in What Do You Call a Person From...? A Dictionary of Resident Names (the first edition of Labels for Locals)[10] attributed the term to George H. Scheetz, in his Names' Names: A Descriptive and Prescriptive Onymicon (1988),[1] which is apparently where the term first appears. The term may have been fashioned after demonymic, which the Oxford English Dictionary defines as the name of an Athenian citizen according to the deme to which the citizen belongs, with its first use traced to 1893.[11][12] Suffixation[edit] Several linguistic elements are used to create demonyms in the English language. The most common is to add a suffix to the end of the location name, slightly modified in some instances. These may resemble Late Latin, Semitic, Celtic, or Germanic suffixes, such as: -(a)n[edit] Continents: Africa → African Antarctica → Antarctican Asia → Asian Australia → Australian Europe → European

Demonyms ending in "-man" theoretically can be considered to refer only to males.

Often used for East Asian and Francophone locations, from the similar-sounding French suffix -ais(e), which is originally from the Latin adjectival ending -ensis, designating origin from a place: thus Hispaniensis (Spanish), Danensis (Danish), etc. -i(e)[edit] Allahabad → Allahabadi Azawad → Azawadi Azerbaijan → Azerbaijani (also "Azeri") Azra → Azragi Balochistan → Balochistani (also "Baloch" or "Baluch") Bahrain → Bahraini Bangladesh → Bangladeshi Bengal → Bengali Bharat → Bharati Bihar → Bihari Dagestan → Dagestani Faridabad → Faridabadi Gujarat → Gujarati Hayastan → Hayastani (also "Armenian") Hazara → Hazaragi (also "Azragi") Hyderabad → Hyderabadi Iran → Irani (also "Iranian" or "Persian") Iraq → Iraqi Israel → Israeli (in the Modern State of Israel) Kashmir → Kashmiri Kazakhstan → Kazakhstani (also "Kazakh") Kuwait → Kuwaiti Kyrgyzstan → Kyrgyzstani (also "Kyrgyz") Lahore → Lahori Nepal → Nepali (also "Nepalese") Oman → Omani Pakistan → Pakistani Punjab → Punjabi Qatar → Qatari Rajasthan → Rajasthani Sindh → Sindhi Somalia → Somali Tajikistan → Tajikistani (also "Tajik") Tel Aviv → Tel Avivi (also "Tel Avivim" (plural)) Turkmenistan → Turkmenistani (also "Turkmen") United Arab Emirates → Emirati Uzbekistan → Uzbekistani (also "Uzbek") Yemen → Yemeni Yorkshire → Yorkie (also "Tyke") Mostly for Middle Eastern and South Asian locales and in Latinate names for the various people that ancient Romans encountered (e.g. Allemanni, Helvetii) -ic[edit] Finland → Finnic → (also "Finnish" or "Finn") Greenland → Greenlandic Iceland → Icelandic (also "Icelander") Slavia →Slavs/Slavic -iot(e)[edit] Corfu → Corfiot Cyprus → Cypriot Phanar → Phanariote Used especially for Greek locations. -asque[edit] Monaco → Monégasque (native citizen of Monaco) Menton → Mentonasque Often used for French locations. -(we)gian[edit] Galloway → Galwegian Galway → Galwegian Glasgow → Glaswegian Norway → Norwegian -onian[edit] Aberdeen → Aberdonian Bath → Bathonian Boston → Bostonian Cork → Corkonian [16] Dundee → Dundonian Halifax → Haligonian Newport → Newportonian Oxford → Oxonian Toronto → Torontonian Often used for British and Irish locations. -vian[edit] Barrow-in-Furness → Barrovian [17] Oamaru → Oamaruvian Oslo → Oslovian Peru → Peruvian Warsaw → Varsovian Waterloo → Waterluvian [18] -ien[edit] Niger → Nigerien -be[edit] Burkina Faso → Burkinabe From Latin or Latinization[edit] Alsace → Alsatian (Alsatia) Ashbourne → Ashburnian (Essiburn) Colchester → Colcestrian Courland → Couronian (Curonia) Exeter → Exonian Germany → German (Germani) Guernsey → Sarnian (Sarnia) Halifax → Haligonian Ireland → Hibernian (Hibernia) Leeds → Leodensian (Ledesia) Lviv → Leopolitan (Leopolis) Manchester → Mancunian (Mancunia) Melbourne → Melburnian (Melburnia) Naples → Neapolitan (Neapolis) Newcastle → Novocastrian (Novum Castrum) Orkney Islands → Orcadian (Orcadia) Shropshire → Salopian (Salopia) Tripoli → Tripolitan (Tripolis) Venice → Venetian Wolverhampton → Wulfrunian Fiction[edit] Literature and science fiction have created a wealth of gentilics that are not directly associated with a cultural group. These will typically be formed using the standard models above. Examples include Martian for hypothetical people of Mars (credited to scientist Percival Lowell) or Gondorian for the people of Tolkien's fictional land of Gondor. Other science fiction examples include Jovian for those of Jupiter or its moons, and Venusian for those of Venus. Fictional aliens refer to the inhabitants of Earth as Earthling (from the diminutive -ling, ultimately from Old English -ing meaning "descendant"), as well as "Terran", "Terrene", "Tellurian", "Earther", "Earthican", "terrestrial", and "Solarian" (from Sol, the sun). Fantasy literature which involves other worlds or other lands also has a rich supply of gentilics. Examples include Lilliputians and Brobdingnagians, from the islands of Lilliput and Brobdingnag in the satire Gulliver's Travels. In a few cases, where a linguistic background has been created, non-standard gentilics are formed (or the eponyms back-formed). Examples include Tolkien's Rohirrim (from Rohan) and the Star Trek world's Klingon people (with various version of homeworld name).
