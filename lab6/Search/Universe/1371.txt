In this article here, it is claimed that "Although usage differs, a government agency is normally distinct both from a Department or Ministry, and other types of public body established by government." However, many (even a majority) of the New Deal agencies that it mentions by way of example are a part of federal executive Departments. Furthermore, the in the U.S., even those departments are defined as federal agencies. Then we get to the U.S. section. It says "The Congress and President of the United States delegate specific authority to government agencies to regulate the complex facets of the modern American federal state." But then it lists the article on the Independent Agencies of the United States Government as being the main article, but that's only are the agencies which actually are independent of Deparments, which is inappropriate. Confusion abounds!

 Government agencies are the official bureaus and offices which the government creates to manage the various issues of public and political life. Any entity which speaks in the name of the government is a government entity or agency like ministries, embassies, managerial entities. They are entities in which the opinion of the government is officially offered and expressed. The term translates to Arabic as الجهات الحكومية.
