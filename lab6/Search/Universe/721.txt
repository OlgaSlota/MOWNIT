It is accompanied by a companion website that features practice test questions and detailed explanations on each chapter. Controversy[edit] The textbook became an item of national news coverage in April, 2008. A New Jersey high school senior expressed concerns to a think tank, the Center for Inquiry, regarding what he felt was conservative[1] bias in the textbook, specifically inaccuracies about its coverage of global warming.[2] The senior also wrote an opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times.[3] The group issued a critical report on the textbook.[4] The group's criticism of the coverage on climate was buttressed by a few scientists, and then additional criticism from legal scholars who claimed the book presented a skewed view of separation of church and state. The publisher Houghton Mifflin announced that it would review the book,[5] as did the College Board which oversees college-level Advanced Placement courses used in high schools.[2] Wilson responded to the complaint in an editorial,[1] arguing that the text is not unduly biased, and that dispute with regard to global warming is considerable.
