This transferred Prattsville, Vly Mountain, Halcott Center, Bushnellsville, Highmount, Shandaken, Lanesville, and Pine Hill within Greene County.[5] On May 26, 1812, Greene County lost 20 square miles (52 km2) to Ulster County, lowering the total area to 690 square miles (1,800 km2), reassigning Pine Hill, Highmount, and Shandaken to Ulster County.[6] On April 15, 1814, the county borders were re-surveyed, and the line adjusted with no change in area.[7] On April 17, 1822, the border was again surveyed, with no change in area, but Palenville was found to be inside Greene County.[8] On April 23, 1823, the border was again resurveyed, and the Hudson River border with Columbia County realigned accordingly.[9] On March 3, 1836, 30 square miles (78 km2) of area was lost to Schoharie County, reducing the total area to 660 square miles (1,700 km2), and reassigning Manorkill, producing the Greene County that exists today.[10] Geography[edit] Kaaterskill Falls is in Greene County According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 658 square miles (1,700 km2), of which 647 square miles (1,680 km2) is land and 11 square miles (28 km2) (1.7%) is water.[11] Greene County is located in southeast central New York State, just west of the Hudson River and south of Albany. The northern and eastern regions are mostly low-lying flatlands. Along the Hudson River the lowest elevation is at sea level. The southern and western areas rise sharply into the Catskill Mountains. Catskill Park takes up much of the south central region. The park contains some of the tallest peaks south of the Adirondacks. For example, the highest elevation is Hunter Mountain, at approximately 4,040 feet (1,232 m) above sea level; In addition, there are many picturesque waterfalls in the park such as the famed, Kaaterskill Falls. The entirety of Greene County is in the 19th Congressional District, and is represented by Chris Gibson.

Politics[edit] Greene County is considered a Republican stronghold. It was one of only 11 counties in New York that did not vote for Bill Clinton in 1996, a strong year for Democrats. It supported John McCain by a margin just under ten points in 2008 over Barack Obama, another Democratic year. In 2012, 54.1% of the county voted for Republican challenger Mitt Romney, and 43.7% voted for Democratic incumbent Obama, again despite it being a Democratic year. It has not supported a Democrat for president since 1964. In some elections, certain towns in Greene County have had a plurality that have voted Democratic, though the county remains very Republican.
