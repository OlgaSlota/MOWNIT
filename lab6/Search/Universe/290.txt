Lloyd's Coffee House - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Lloyd's Coffee House From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search A 19th-century drawing of Lloyd's Coffee House This blue plaque in Lombard Street marks the location of the former coffee house. Lloyd's Coffee House was a coffee shop in London opened by Edward Lloyd (c. 1648–15 February 1713)[1] originally on Tower Street in around 1688. The establishment was a popular place for sailors, merchants and shipowners, and Lloyd catered to them with reliable shipping news. The shipping industry community frequented the place to discuss insurance deals among themselves. The dealing that took place led to the establishment of the insurance market Lloyd's of London, Lloyd's Register and several related shipping and insurance businesses. Just after Christmas 1691, the coffee shop relocated to Lombard Street. Merchants continued to discuss insurance matters here until 1774 when the participating members of the insurance arrangement formed a committee and moved to the Royal Exchange on Cornhill as the Society of Lloyd's. Traces of the coffee house[edit] The 17th century original shop frontage of Lloyd's Coffee House is owned by Lloyd's of London and has been re-erected on display at the National Maritime Museum.[2] A blue plaque in Lombard Street commemorates the coffee house's second location (now occupied at ground level by Sainsbury's supermarket).[3] It was fictionalized in the 1936 film Lloyd's of London.
