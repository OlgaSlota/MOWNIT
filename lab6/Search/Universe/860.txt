Sitcom - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Sitcom From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search For the satirical film by François Ozon, see Sitcom (film). "Situation Comedy" redirects here. It is not to be confused with Situation Comedy (album). A situation comedy, or sitcom, is a genre of comedy centered on characters who share a common environment, such as a home or workplace, with often-humorous dialogue. Sitcoms originated in radio, but today are found mostly on television as one of its dominant narrative forms. This form can also include mockumentaries. A situation comedy television program may be recorded in front of a studio audience, depending on the program's production format. The effect of a live studio audience can be imitated or enhanced by the use of a laugh track.

(October 2015) History[edit] Main articles: History of radio, Radio comedy, History of television and Television comedy The terms "situational comedy" or "sitcom" weren't commonly used until 1950s.[1] Some of the characters, pratfalls, routines and situations as preserved in eyewitness accounts and in the texts of the plays themselves, are remarkably similar to those in earlier modern sitcoms such as I Love Lucy and The Honeymooners. The first television sitcom is said to be Pinwright's Progress, ten episodes being broadcast on the BBC in the United Kingdom between 1946 and 1947.[2][3] In the United States, director and producer William Asher has been credited with being the "man who invented the sitcom",[4] having directed over two dozen of the leading sitcoms, including I Love Lucy, from the 1950s through the 1970s. By country[edit] Australia[edit] See also: Television in Australia and Television ratings in Australia There have been few long-running Australian-made sitcoms, but many U.S. and UK sitcoms have been successful there. UK sitcoms are a staple of government broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC); in the 1970s and 1980s many UK sitcoms also screened on the Seven Network. By 1986, UK comedies Bless This House and Are You Being Served? had been repeated by ABC Television several times, and were then acquired and screened by the Seven Network, in prime time.[5] In 1981, Daily at Dawn was the first Australian comedy series to feature a regular gay character (Terry Bader as journalist Leslie).[6] In 1987, Mother and Son was winner of the Television Drama Award presented by the Australian Human Rights Commission.[7][8] In 2007, Kath & Kim The first episode of series four attracted an Australian audience of 2.521 million nationally,[9] the highest rating ever for a first episode in the history of Australian television,[9] until the series premiere of Underbelly: A Tale of Two Cities in 2009 with 2.58m viewers.[10] In 2013, Please Like Me was praised by the critics,[11][12][13][14][15][16][17] receiving an invitation to screen at the Series Mania Television Festival in Paris.[18] and has garnered three awards and numerous nominations.[19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26] Also in 2013, At Home With Julia was criticised by several social commentators as inappropriately disrespectful to the office of Prime Minister,[27] the show nevertheless proved very popular both with television audiences — becoming the most watched Australian scripted comedy series of 2011[28] — and with television critics.[29] Nominated to the 2012 Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts Awards for Best Television Comedy Series.[30] Canada[edit] See also: Canadian humour and Television in Canada The popular show King of Kensington, aired from 1975 to 1980, prior to the start of the fourth season drew 1.5 to 1.8 million viewers weekly.[31] Corner Gas, which ran for six seasons from 2004 to 2009, became an instant hit, averaging a million viewers per episode.[32] 1.5 million viewers in its first episode on January 22, 2004.

Gradually, as private channels were allowed, many more sitcoms followed in the 1990s, such as Zabaan Sambhalke (1993), Shrimaan Shrimati (1995), Office Office (2001), Khichdi (2002), Sarabhai vs Sarabhai (2005) to F.I.R. (2006- 2015) & Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah, (2008–present).[36][37] Mexico[edit] See also: Television in Mexico El Chavo del Ocho, which ran from 1971 to 1980, was the most watched show in the Mexican television and had a Latin American audience of 350 million viewers per episode at its peak of popularity during the mid-1970s.[38] The show continues to be popular in Hispanic America as well as in Brazil, Spain, United States and other countries, with syndicated episodes averaging 91 million daily viewers in all of the markets where it is distributed in the Americas.[39][40] Since it ceased production in 1992, the show has earned an estimated billion in syndication fees alone for Televisa.[40] New Zealand[edit] See also: Television in New Zealand and List of New Zealand television series Gliding On, a popular sit-com in New Zealand in the early 1980s, won multiple awards over the course of its run, including Best Comedy, Best Drama and Best Direction at the Feltex Awards.[41] Russia[edit] See also: Television in Russia and Media of Russia The first Russian sitcom series was "Strawberry" (resembled "Duty Pharmacy" in Spanish format), which was aired in 1996-1997 on the RTR channel. However, the "boom" of Russian sitcoms began only in the 2000s - when in 2004 the STS started very successful sitcom "My Fair Nanny" (an adaptation of the American sitcom "The Nanny"). Since that time sitcoms in Russia were produced by the two largest entertainment channels of the country - STS and TNT. In 2007 the STS released the first original domestic sitcom - "Daddy's Daughters" (there were only adaptation before), and in 2010 TNT released "Interns (sitcom)" - the first sitcom, filmed as a comedy (unlike dominated "conveyor" sitcoms). United Kingdom[edit] Main article: British sitcom See also: Television in the United Kingdom In 2004, Are You Being Served? was ranked 20th in the countdown of Britain's Best Sitcom.[42] United States[edit] See also: American humor It has been suggested that this section be split into an article titled American sitcom. (Discuss) (December 2014) Most American sitcoms generally include episodes of 20 to 30 minutes in length, where the story is written to run a total of 22 minutes in length, leaving eight minutes for commercials.[43] Some popular British shows have been successfully adapted for the U.S.[44] Sitcoms on U.S. radio[edit] See also: Radio in the United States and List of United States radio networks The sitcom format was born in January 1926 with the initial broadcast of Sam 'n' Henry on WGN radio in Chicago, Illinois.[45] The 15-minute daily program was revamped in 1928, moved to another station, renamed Amos 'n' Andy, and became one of the most successful sitcoms of the period. It was also one of the earliest examples of radio syndication. Like many radio programs of the time, the two programs continued the American entertainment traditions of vaudeville and the minstrel show. The Jack Benny Program, a radio-TV comedy series that ran for more than three decades, is generally regarded as a high-water mark in 20th-century American comedy.[46] Sitcoms on U.S. television[edit] See also: Television in the United States, List of American television series, List of American television shows currently in production, and List of American television programs by date 1940s–1950s[edit] Mary Kay and Johnny, aired from 1947 to 1950, was the first sitcom broadcast on a network television in the United States and was the first program to show a couple sharing a bed, and the first series to show a woman's pregnancy on television.[47][48] I Love Lucy, which originally ran from 1951 to 1957 on CBS, was the most watched show in the United States in four of its six seasons, and was the first to end its run at the top of the Nielsen ratings (an accomplishment later matched only by The Andy Griffith Show in 1968 and Seinfeld in 1998) . The show is still syndicated in dozens of languages across the world, and remains popular, with an American audience of 40 million each year.[49] A colorized version of its Christmas episode attracted more than eight million viewers when CBS aired it in prime time in 2013 – 62 years after the show premiered.[50] A second colorized special, featuring the "L.A. At Last!" and "Lucy and Superman" episodes, aired on May 17, 2015, attracting 6.4 million viewers.[51] It is often regarded as one of the greatest and most influential sitcoms in history. In 2012, it was voted the 'Best TV Show of All Time' in a survey conducted by ABC News and People Magazine.[52] The Honeymooners debuted as a half-hour series on 1955 and was originally aired on the DuMont network's Cavalcade of Stars and subsequently on the CBS network's The Jackie Gleason Show,[53] which was filmed in front of a live audience. Although initially a ratings success—becoming the #2 show in the United States during its first season—it faced stiff competition from The Perry Como Show,[54][55] and eventually dropped to #19,[55][56] ending its production after only 39 episodes (now referred to as the "Classic 39"). The final episode of The Honeymooners aired on September 22, 1956. Creator/producer Jackie Gleason revived The Honeymooners sporadically until 1978. The Honeymooners was one of the first U.S. television shows to portray working-class married couples in a gritty, non-idyllic manner (the show is set mostly in the Kramdens' kitchen, in a neglected Brooklyn apartment building).[57] Steven Sheehan explains the popularity of The Honeymooners as the embodiment of working-class masculinity in the character of Ralph Kramden, and postwar ideals in American society regarding work, housing, consumerism, and consumer satisfaction. The series demonstrated visually the burdens of material obligations and participation in consumer culture, as well as the common use of threats of domestic violence in working class households.[58] Art Carney won five Emmy Awards for his portrayal of Ed Norton — two for the original Jackie Gleason Show, one for The Honeymooners, and two for the final version of The Jackie Gleason Show. He was nominated for another two (1957, 1966) but lost. Gleason and Audrey Meadows were both nominated in 1956 for their work on The Honeymooners. Meadows was also nominated for Emmys for her portrayal of Alice Kramden in 1954 and 1957.[59][60] In 1997, the episodes "The $99,000 Answer" and "TV or Not TV" were respectively ranked #6 and #26 on "TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time"[61] and in 1999, TV Guide published a list titled "TV's 100 Greatest Characters Ever!"
