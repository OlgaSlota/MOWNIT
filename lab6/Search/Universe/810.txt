List of cities in Ontario - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia List of cities in Ontario From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search A city is a sub-type of municipalities in the Canadian Province of Ontario. A city can have the municipal status of either a single-tier or lower-tier municipality. Ontario has 51 cities[1] that had a cumulative population of 9,293,031 and an average population of 182,216 in the 2011 Census.[2] Ontario's largest and smallest cities are Toronto and Dryden with populations of 2,615,060 and 7,617 respectively.[2] Ontario's newest city is Markham, which changed from a town to a city on July 1, 2012.[3] Contents 1 History 2 Cities in Ontario 3 See also 4 References History[edit] Under the former Municipal Act, 1990, a city was both an urban and a local municipality.[4] Under this former legislation, the Municipal Board could change the status of a village or town to a city, upon review of an application from the village or town, if it had a population of 15,000 or more.[4] The Municipal Board could also incorporate a township as a city under the same conditions with the exception that the population requirements was 25,000 or more.[4] In the event an application was received from a village, town or township located within a county, the application could have only been approved by the Municipal Board if authorized by the Minister of Municipal Affairs.[4] In the transition to the Municipal Act, 2001, these requirements were abandoned and, as at December 31, 2002, every city that:[5] "existed and formed part of a county, a regional or district municipality or the County of Oxford for municipal purposes" became a lower-tier municipality yet retained its name as a city; and "existed and did not form part of a county, a regional or district municipality or the County of Oxford for municipal purposes" became a single-tier municipality yet retained its name as a city. The current legislation also provides lower and single-tier municipalities with the authority to name themselves as "cities", or other former municipal status types such as "towns", "villages" or "townships", or generically as "municipalities".[6] Cities in Ontario[edit] Toronto is Ontario's capital and largest city and Canada's largest city Ottawa is Canada's capital and Ontario's second
