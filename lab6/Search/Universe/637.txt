This generally means that you won't find me getting into drawn out arguments surrounding any of wikipedia's hot button pages as there are usually countless other editors who do so with far more zeal than I can muster. I've also found that the more important articles tend to be very good and adhere to wikipedia's policies. The problem is that articles of secondary importance are far less closely scrutinized, despite the fact that wikipedia is often considered a prime source of information about those sorts of subjects. Therefore I tend to spend a lot of time working on those sorts of articles. I also like to see the overall quality and framework of the encyclopedia maintained so I spend a lot of time WikiGnoming. You'll often see me fixing typos, correcting spelling, citing facts, making inline refs, cleaning up link spam, and countless other such tasks. All of that being said, one of the things I like about wikipedia is it's breadth, and there is almost nothing I haven't worked on at one time or another, so don't be surprised to see me pop up pretty much anywhere. Photographic contributions (in the commons)[edit] My photographic contributions are currently too numerous to list here. If you want to see an updated list, check my photo album on the commons. My shortcuts[edit] In progress[edit] User:Bachrach44/Joseph Molcho Israel[edit] dead links to fr.jpost.com Jewish[edit] Passover Seder cleanup, add information on origins Manischewitz improve wine section Jose ben Joezer - the first Nasi Megillat Antiochus refs Others[edit] Category:United States articles missing geocoordinate data - find some coords Counters[edit] My first edit was in June of 2005, although I didn't really start editing until the fall of that year. I used to have a serious case of editcountitis, which I am mostly recovered from now. My edit rate is still high because I spend a lot of time working on minor things to improve wikipedia. I stopped caring about my edit count sometime after I hit 10,000, but you're welcome to look if you like. counter Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Bachrach44&oldid=651683939" Categories: User en-N User he-2 Navigation menu Personal tools Not logged in Talk Contributions Create account Log in Namespaces User page Talk Variants Views Read Edit View history More Search Navigation Main page Contents Featured content Current events Random article Donate to Wikipedia Wikipedia store Interaction Help About Wikipedia Community portal Recent changes Contact page Tools What links here Related changes User contributions Logs Upload file Special pages Permanent link Page information Print/export Create a book Download as PDF Printable version Languages This page was last modified on 16 March 2015, at 20:42.
