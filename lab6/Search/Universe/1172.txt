Somebody defaced this page! —Preceding unsigned comment added by 24.17.170.160 (talk • contribs) Redirect?[edit] This page has basically 0 content and is acting at the moment as a very minimal, and improper, disambiguity page. I would say it should either be beefed up with some actual content or redirected to Action film (which I see it was a while back) and I'm leaning toward redirection as most everything said here would be redundant with Action film anyway. We already have an Action disambiguity page so I don't see that as a good option at all. Derekloffin 18:55, 1 November 2007 (UTC) Probably redirect to Action film. Lord Sesshomaru (talk • edits) 19:10, 1 November 2007 (UTC) I have removed the merge tag because I'd like to see if others think it needs expansion or something else. Lord Sesshomaru (talk • edits) 19:11, 11 February 2008 (UTC) Split and disambiguate[edit] Sections 1 and 2 should be developed as separate articles, one for the mode and one for the genre. * ? one of Action mode, Action (mode), Action (literary mode), Action (rhetorical mode) * either Action genre or Action (genre) --P64 (talk) 19:55, 18 December 2014 (UTC) This should be a disambiguation page or it should redirect to a fiction {{anchor}} within Action (disambiguation) --the latter if i understand correctly. Either way, the stub Action (literature) should be a third disambiguant. --P64 (talk) 19:40, 18 December 2014 (UTC) Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Action_(fiction)&oldid=638681489" Categories: Stub-Class Literature articles Unknown-importance Literature articles Navigation menu Personal tools Not logged in Talk Contributions Create account Log in Namespaces Article Talk Variants Views Read Edit New section View history More Search Navigation Main page Contents Featured content Current events Random article Donate to Wikipedia Wikipedia store Interaction Help About Wikipedia Community portal Recent changes Contact page Tools What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Permanent link Page information Print/export Create a book Download as PDF Printable version Languages This page was last modified on 18 December 2014, at 19:56.
