He practiced judo as a child, but he didn't get very far in terms of graduation. Some scenes of the film were filmed at the traditional academy Vila Sônia, in São Paulo. It was there that the Olympic champion Aurélio Miguel began practicing the sport and where Caio made an immersion with renowned technicians as the masters Massao and Luiz Shinohara, current men's team coach.[3] References[edit] ^ "Filme com Caio Castro aposta em sucesso fora do pódio para elevar judô".
