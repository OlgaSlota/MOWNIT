Outline of academic disciplines - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Outline of academic disciplines From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search Main article: Discipline (academia) Mind map of top level disciplines and professions The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to academic disciplines: An academic discipline or field of study is a branch of knowledge that is taught and researched as part of higher education. A scholar's discipline is commonly defined and recognized by the university faculties and learned societies to which he or she belongs and the academic journals in which he or she publishes research. However, no formal criteria exist for defining an academic discipline. Disciplines vary between well-established ones that exist in almost all universities and have well-defined rosters of journals and conferences and nascent ones supported by only a few universities and publications. A discipline may have branches, and these are often called sub-disciplines. There is no consensus on how some academic disciplines should be classified (e.g., whether anthropology and linguistics are disciplines of social sciences or fields within the humanities). More generally, the proper criteria for organizing knowledge into disciplines are also open to debate.
