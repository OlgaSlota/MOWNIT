 style issue[edit] Hi, When you're replying to comments, can you please take care to differentiate your reply from the original comment. In the "Pong movie" comment, you inserted your reply and sig after the original comment, but before the original poster's sig. If it's just a single sentence you're replying to, simply put it after the whole thing. On the other hand, if you need to reply in the middle of part of another comment, try to make it separate like this Indented reply with sig.

Hope you enjoy Wikipedia. Cheers!
