The legislation was signed by Governor of New Jersey Woodrow Wilson on April 25, 1911. The commissions in Walsh Act municipalities are composed of either three or five members elected for four-year concurrent terms. The commissioners also serve as department heads in addition to their legislative functions. The commissioners elect one commissioner as mayor, however the mayor is only responsible for his or her departments and serves as the chair of the commission. The Walsh Act was modeled on the commission system that was set up in Galveston, Texas in the wake of the devastating Hurricane of 1900. As part of its reconstruction efforts, the city reorganized itself to a government system in which each elected official had a specific area of responsibility, combining executive and legislative responsibilities. The Walsh Act was enacted in 1911, and specified that commissioners would be elected at large in nonpartisan elections, and would serve four-year, concurrent terms of office. The Walsh Act was the first charter law in New Jersey to include options for ballot initiatives, referendums and recall.[1] Contents 1 Municipalities that have a five member commission 2 Municipalities that have a three member commission 3 See also 4 References 5 External links Municipalities that have a five member commission[edit] These communities have five commissioners: Commissioner of Public Affairs Commissioner of Public Safety Commissioner of Public Works Commissioner of Parks and Public Property Commissioner of Revenue and Finance Municipality County Year Adopted Lyndhurst Township Bergen 1913 Millville City Cumberland 1913 North Bergen Township Hudson 1931 Nutley Township Essex 1912 Ridgefield Park Village Bergen 1912 Union City Hudson 1930 West New York Town Hudson 1931 Municipalities that have a three member commission[edit] These communities have three commissioners: Commissioner of Public Affairs and Public Safety Commissioner of Public Works, Parks and Public Property Commissioner of Revenue and Finance Municipality County Year Adopted Allenhurst Borough Monmouth 1916 Audubon Borough Camden 1921 Avon-by-the-Sea Borough Monmouth 1919 Bass River Township Burlington 1972 Beach Haven Borough Ocean 1946 Bordentown City Burlington 1913 Bradley Beach Borough Monmouth 1915 Cape May Point Borough Cape May 1916 Collingswood Borough Camden 1917 Deal Borough Monmouth 1912 Haddon Township Camden 1950 Haddonfield Borough Camden 1913 Harvey Cedars Borough Ocean 1923 Long Beach Township Ocean 1936 Longport Borough Atlantic 1912 Margate City Atlantic 1911 Monmouth Beach Borough Monmouth 1929 Mount Ephraim Borough Camden 1935 Pine Valley Borough Camden 1942 Sea Isle City Cape May 1913 Tavistock Borough Camden 1928 Ventnor City Atlantic 1968 West Cape May Borough Cape May 1948 West Wildwood Borough Cape May 1964 Wildwood Crest Borough Cape May 1937 See also[edit] 1923 Municipal Manager Law References[edit] ^ Wolfe, Albert J.
