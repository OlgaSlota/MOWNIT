It is located in largely industrial Port Lands area of the city along the shore of Toronto Harbour. Polson Pier is also home of the Sound Academy, which is a concert hall/nightclub with a capacity of 3,230 occupants over 13,240 square feet (1,230 m2) of floor space. A balcony is located above. The site is also home to an extensive amusement area, with facilities for go karts, rock climbing, swimming, mini golf, beach volleyball, and a driving range. The Lakeview Drive-In is located at the far end of the driving range that is used during the day. The site is converted into a drive-in theater at sunset. It is the only drive-in movie theatre in downtown Toronto. Open on summer weekends, the drive-in can accommodate up to 1200 people and 500 vehicles. In 1999 there was discussion that ferries from the Toronto Ferry Services should depart from a landing at the Docks.[1] On July 24, 2006 the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario revoked the Docks' liquor licence. This was the culmination of a 10-year-long dispute with the Toronto Islands' residents regarding excessive noise. [2] On July 28, 2006 the Court of Appeal for Ontario judge granted a stay, pending an appeal heard January, 2007. [3] By the summer of 2008, the complex had been sold to new owners who took measures to appease its neighbours, including ending all-night parties and soundproofing its indoor venue.[4] The complex lies between the Polson Slip to the north and the channel to Toronto's turning basin to the south.
