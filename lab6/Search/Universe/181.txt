Húsönd 14:55, 23 August 2006 (UTC) Thank you!  My first thought was that this kind gesture made you eligible for the same barnstar – except I guess your action isn't random...!  So here is a citation instead... Best wishes, David 17:47, 23 August 2006 (UTC) The Barnstar of Diligence CNASbyC table and LCTNAS table are simply incredible examples of intellegence, dilegence above and beyond, not to mention some great wikimarkup knowledge! HATS OFF TO YOU, David! In humblest awe, I stand in your shadow as a pigmy to a giant! // FrankB 18:16, 31 August 2006 (UTC) Thank you, with apologies for not acknowledging your gesture more quickly!  "If I have been able to work that little further, it is by leaning on the support of giant hearts" — not Isaac Newton and not about the stature of internal organs. Best wishes, David Kernow 01:56, 2 September 2006 (UTC) Rescue From Deletion Award "Awarded to editors who rescue a stub or an article from deletion with excellent writing." - For being the first person I can recall who, following closing a Wikipedia:Categories for Discussion nomination with the result of "Listify", actually created the list! - jc37 21:42, 27 October 2006 (UTC) Thanks jc37!  I hope I won't regret trying to continue in the same vein... Best wishes, David Kernow (talk) 20:16, 28 October 2006 (UTC) For your contributions to Wikipedia and humanity in general, you are hereby granted the coveted Random Smiley Award by Pedia-I Project Jesus (Explanation and Disclaimer) Thanks for the Smiley Award. I didn't notice it until now. ;-) --Nlu (talk) 05:54, 4 November 2006 (UTC) Ditto!  (Although I did notice your post a little while ago. I guess your criteria are in a safe somewhere next to the Coca-Cola formulation...)  Chuckle, David Kernow (talk) 01:12, 5 November 2006 (UTC) The da Vinci Barnstar For your invaluable technical work. Timrollpickering 18:45, 29 December 2006 (UTC) ...so my thanks for that as well as for your generous barnstar!  (I guess you've been talking with the End-of-Year Bunny...?)  Chuckle, David (talk) 12:09, 30 December 2006 (UTC) The Barnstar EATEN BY A BEAR - Awarded to any Wikipedian who says something very humorous and or random, thus cheering up fellow Wikipedians who read it. (Bowing to your erudite knowledge : ) - jc37 09:39, 2 January 2007 (UTC) ...meantime, I've that new grizzly friend to feed, so better move him into that small village – thank you for your continued generosity!  Yours, David (talk) 12:53, 2 January 2007 (UTC) The Template Barnstar Thanks for all your sterling work maintaining templates. It might not glamorous work but your efforts are appreciated. Valentinian T / C 20:24, 29 March 2007 (UTC) Thanks for your generosity! ... David (talk) 20:39, 29 March 2007 (UTC) The Template Barnstar I noticed you just got one, but I had to come here and give you a barnstar. {{·}} is quite an innovative template; thank you so much for creating it. ShadowHalo 15:21, 30 March 2007 (UTC) Thanks for making the barnstar stereo! ... {{·}} seems to work best on the handful of screens and printers I've seen it on; ideally, though, I reckon there could be a "set separator character" preference option (which also uses the &nbsp; formatting). A couple of people said it was tricky to input, which I guess is true if you're not keen on pasting, macros or key combinations, but the "middot" character seemed appropriate for a short template name. Anyway, happy to know some folk like it!  Best wishes, David (talk) 04:35, 2 April 2007 (UTC) The da Vinci Barnstar This is awarded to you for making Wikipedia a better place and for your valued assisstance to Wikipedians.
