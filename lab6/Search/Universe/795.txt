Malay alphabet - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Malay alphabet From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia   (Redirected from Rumi script) Jump to: navigation, search This article is about what is sometimes called "Rumi script". For other uses of "Rumi", see Rumi (disambiguation). The modern Malay alphabet (in Brunei, Malaysia and Singapore, Tulisan Rumi, literally "Roman script" or "Roman writing", in Indonesia, "Tulisan Latin") consists of the 26 letters of the ISO basic Latin alphabet without any diacritics.[1] It is the more common of the two alphabets used today to write the Malay language, the other being Jawi (a modified Arabic script). The Latin Malay alphabet is the official Malay script in Indonesia (as Indonesian), Malaysia (as Malaysian) and Singapore, while it is co-official with Jawi in Brunei. Historically, various scripts such as Pallava, Kawi and Rencong were used to write Old Malay, until they were replaced by Jawi with the introduction of Islam. The arrival of European colonial powers brought the Latin alphabet to the Malay Archipelago. As the Malay-speaking countries were divided between two colonial administrations (the Dutch and the British), two major different spelling orthographies were developed in the Dutch East Indies and British Malaya respectively, influenced by the orthographies of their respective colonial tongues. The Soewandi Spelling System (or the Republic Spelling System after independence), used in the Dutch East Indies and later in independent Indonesia until 1972, was based on the Dutch alphabet. In 1972, as part of the effort of harmonizing spelling differences between the two countries, Indonesia and Malaysia each adopted a spelling reform plan, called the Perfected Spelling System (Ejaan yang Disempurnakan) in Indonesia and the New Rumi Spelling (Ejaan Rumi Baharu[2]) in Malaysia. Although the representations of speech sounds are now largely identical in the Indonesian and Malaysian varieties, a number of minor spelling differences remain.

Indonesia follows the letter names of the Dutch alphabet, while Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore follow the English alphabet. Regardless of the letter names, however, the letters represent the same sounds in all Malay-speaking countries. The Malay alphabet has a phonemic orthography; words are spelled the way they are pronounced, with few exceptions. The letters Q, V and X are rarely encountered, being chiefly used for writing loanwords.

Many vowels were pronounced and formerly spelt differently that way also in East Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia. In addition, there are digraphs that are not considered separate letters of the alphabet:[3] Digraph Sound IPA Notes Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore Indonesia ai /ai̯/ uy as in buy au /au̯/ ou as in ouch oi /oi̯/ /ʊi̯/ oy as in boy gh /ɣ/ ~ /x/ French r kh /x/ ch as in loch ng /ŋ/ ng as in sing ny /ɲ/ Spanish ñ; similar to ny as in canyon with a nasal sound sy /ʃ/ sh as in shoe Pre-1972 Spelling System[edit] 1927 Za'aba and 1947 Soewandi Spelling Systems[edit] 1927 Za'aba Spelling System Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore Majuscule Forms A Ă B C D E Ĕ F G H I Ï J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z Minuscule Forms a ă b c d e ĕ f g h i ï j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z 1901 Van Ophuijsen Spelling System and 1947 Soewandi Spelling System Indonesia Majuscule Forms A B C D E É F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T Oe(1901)/U(1947) V W X Y Z Minuscule Forms a b c d e é f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t oe(1901)/u(1947) v w x y z Letter Sound Post-1972 Replacement 1927 Za'aba Spelling System (Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore) 1901 Van Ophuijsen Spelling System, 1947 Soewandi Spelling System (Indonesia) Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore Indonesia ă /ə/ - e - ch /t͡ʃ/ /x/ c kh dh /d/ - d - dj - /d͡ʒ/ - j dz /z/ - d - e - /ə/ - e /e/ - e - /ɛ/ - e - é - /e/ - e - /ɪ/ - e ĕ /ə/ - e - ï /i/ (monophthong) - i - j - /j/ - y nj - /ɲ/ - ny oe - /u/ - u sh /ʃ/ - sy - sj - /ʃ/ - sy th /s/ - s - tj - /t͡ʃ/ - c See also[edit] Jawi alphabet References[edit] ^ Before a spelling reform in 1972, Indonesia would disambiguate /e/ as é and /ə/ as e, and Malaysia /e/ as e and /ə/ as ĕ.
