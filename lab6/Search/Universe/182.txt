Húsönd "Húsönd" (IPA: [ˈhuːsœnt]) is the Icelandic name for the migratory duck Barrow's Goldeneye. There seems to be a growing misconception that I'm from Iceland, but I happen to be a Portuguese user who simply decided to pick an Icelandic nickname upon creating his account on Wikipedia. I joined the Wikipedia Community in July 2006, and became an administrator in November 2006. I'm a friendly user and will be glad to help should you require my assistance. I make mistakes sometimes, so please always let me know when I err. If you'd like to know more about me, check out my userbox subpage.
