But it’s the performances that really carry this film. Cole’s intense portrayal marks him as one to watch and rapper English Frank also impresses as the prison’s posturing, cod Jamaican kingpin Jake."[8] In general the reviews rate the film for its depiction of characters involved in and affected by the riots. The Londonist states "It’s a surprisingly comprehensive look at the lives of young criminals, in particular their sense of isolation and disenchantment with a corrupt system."[9] Urban and music press[edit] The film has gained overwhelmingly positive reviews from urban and music press including [The Grime Report] who rated the film 10/10, calling the film "one of the few modern day UK classic's [sic]."[10] Music sites Bring The Noise and MTV have rated the film 8/10[11] and 7/10[12] respectively.
