In each of these regions, German, along with the official language of the host nation, is an official language on the administrative level. Region Country Population 2006/2011 Native speakers Notes Autonomous Province of South Tyrol  Italy 511,750 354,643 (69.3%)[5] Co-official language on province level; equal to Italian Opole Voivodeship (28 communes) Silesian Voivodeship (3 communes)  Poland 250,000 ~50,000 (~20%)[6] Auxiliary language in 31 communes;[7] also national minority language[8] Espírito Santo (5 municipalities) Santa Catarina (2 municipalities) Rio Grande do Sul (2 municipalities)  Brazil 205,000 N/A Co-official language in 9 municipalities[9] (as "German", "Pomeranian", and "Hunsrückisch"); also statewide cultural language in Espírito Santo[10] In the two Slovakian villages of Krahule/Blaufuss and Kunešov/Kuneschhau (total population 530) the percentage of ethnic Germans exceeds 20%,[11] therefore making German a co-official language according to Slovakian law.[12][13][14] However, due to the size of the villages and the approximate number of native German speakers (~100), the administrative impact is negligible. Other legal statuses[edit] Legal statuses of German in the world (see preceding image for color descriptions) See also: Geographical distribution of German speakers There are other political entities (countries as well as dependent entities) which acknowledge other legal statuses for the German language or one of its dialects. While these may cover minority rights, support of certain language facilities (schools, media, etc.), and the promotion of cultural protection/heritage, they do not encompass the establishment of German as an "official" language, i.e., being required in public offices or administrative texts.  Brazil (cultural language in Espírito Santo; also co-official in 9 municipalities in southern Brazil)[10]  Bosnia and Herzegovina (national minority language)[8]  Czech Republic (national minority language)[4][8][15]  Denmark (minority language in Syddanmark)[8][16][17]  Hungary (national minority language)[8][18][19]  Italy (outside South Tyrol) (minority language in Trentino[20][21] (as "Cimbrian" & "Mòcheno/Fersentalerisch"); Piedmont[22]/Valle d'Aosta[23] (as Walser German); Friuli-Venezia Giulia[24] (various dialects))  Kazakhstan (national minority language)[25]  Namibia (national language; co-official language 1984–90)[4][26]  Poland (national minority language; also auxiliary language in 31 communes)[8]  Romania (national minority language)[4][8][27]  Russia (minority language in the Azov German National District)[28]  Slovakia (national minority language; also co-official in 2 villages)[8]  Ukraine (national minority language)[8] Although in  France, the High German varieties Alsatian and Moselle Franconian are identified as "regional languages" according to the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages of 1998, the French government has not yet ratified the treaty, and those varieties have no official legal status.[29] The constitution of  South Africa identifies German as a "commonly used" language and the Pan South African Language Board is obligated to "promote and ensure respect" for it.[30] Due to the German diaspora, other countries with sizable populations of (mostly bilingual) German L1 speakers include  Argentina,  Australia,  Canada,  Paraguay, as well as the  United States.[31] However, in none of these countries, German or a German variety have any legal status. In the  Netherlands, the Limburgish, Frisian, and Low German languages are protected regional languages according to the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages,[8] however they are widely considered separate languages and neither German nor Dutch dialects. International institutions[edit] German is an official language of the following international institutions: European Patent Organisation – EPO European Space Agency – ESA European Union - EU Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe - OSCE Reporters Without Borders – RWB World Association of Newspapers – WAN Numerous international sports associations: European Handball Federation – EHF Fédération Internationale de Basketball – FIBA Fédération Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing – FIBT Fédération Internationale de Football Association – FIFA Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique – FIG Fédération Internationale de Luge de Course – FIL Fédération Internationale de Ski – FIS International Biathlon Union – IBU Union of European Football Associations – UEFA Notes[edit] ^ While several specific laws, e.g., §23 VwVfG or $184 GVG, specify German as the administrative language in Germany, the Grundgesetz does not specifically mention it as federal official language.
