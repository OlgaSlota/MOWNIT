Scherzo in A-flat major (Borodin) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Scherzo in A-flat major (Borodin) From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search The first 6 bars of Borodin's Scherzo in A-flat major  Play (help·info) Alexander Borodin's Scherzo in A-flat major is a lively piece written in 1885, while Borodin was in Belgium for an early performance of his then incomplete opera Prince Igor.[1] It was originally written for solo piano but in 1889 Alexander Glazunov orchestrated it, along with the Petite Suite.[2] Borodin dedicated the piece to Théodore Jadoul, who made a four-hand piano arrangement of it.[3] Contents 1 Style 2 Recordings 3 Orchestration 4 See also 5 References 6 External links Style[edit] The Scherzo can be recognized as one of Borodin's compositions instantaneously because of its bright tone, pounding rhythms and exciting melodies. In the main theme of the piece a constant rhythm is used, giving it a clear beat, but unfortunately this also makes it very challenging for the pianist due to the constant jumps required. The piece often modulates, making it more interesting and varied. Played at correct speed, the piece only lasts around three minutes. However this "miniature" offers an admirable summary of its composer's style.[1][4] Recordings[edit] Alexander Borodin The following pianists have recorded the piece: Pianist Duration Record Label Recording Date Vladimir Ashkenazy[5] 02:48 Philips Records 1983 Margaret Fingerhut[6] 02:58 Chandos Records 1985 Philip Edward Fisher[7] 03:22 Chandos Records 2011 Roberto Giordano[8] 03:12 Cypress Records 2004 Dirk Joeres[9] 02:59 Largo Records 1986 Vladimir Leyetchkiss[10] 03:15 Centaur Records 1991 Sergei Rachmaninoff[11] 02:57 RCA Victor[12] 1935 Marco Rapetti[13] 03:21[14] Brilliant Classics 2008 Victor Ryabchikov[15] 03:04 Olympia Records 1999 Joseph Villa[16] 02:49 Dante Records 1980 Alexander Glazunov Orchestration[edit] In 1889, just two years after Borodin's Death, Alexander Glazunov orchestrated the Petite Suite.[2] Glazunov's orchestration of the Suite makes the 7th movement (Finale) the Scherzo, with the Nocturne inserted inside it as a trio section. The total length of the movement is around eight minutes.[17][18] See also[edit] List of compositions by Alexander Borodin References[edit] ^ a b Scherzo in A-flat at allmusic ^ a b Alexander Glazunov ^ Book: Borodin and Liszt by A.
