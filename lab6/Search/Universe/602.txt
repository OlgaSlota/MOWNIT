City names are in all upper case, and district names have initial capitals. New Zealand, although a unitary state, is divided into sixteen regions for devolved local government. Eleven are administered by regional councils (the top tier of local government), and five are administered by unitary authorities, which are territorial authorities (the second tier of local government) that also perform the functions of regional councils.[1][2] The Chatham Islands Council is similar to a unitary authority, authorised under its own legislation.[3] Most regions are composed of districts and cities, which are in turn governed by district councils and city councils.

The regional councils replaced the more than 700 ad hoc bodies that had been formed in the preceding century – roads boards, catchment boards, drainage boards, pest control boards, harbour boards, domain and reserve boards.[7] In addition they took over some roles that had previously been performed by county councils. Auckland Regional Council, formed in 1989, was replaced by Auckland Council, a unitary authority, in 2010. The boundaries of the regions are based largely on drainage basins. This anticipated the responsibilities of the Resource Management Act 1991.[8] Most regional boundaries conform with territorial authority boundaries but there are many exceptions. An example is Taupo District, split between four regions, although most of its area is in the Waikato region. Responsibilities[edit] Regional authorities are primarily responsible for environmental management, including water, contaminant discharge and coastal management, river and lake management including flood and drainage control, regional land management; regional transport (including public transport) and harbours, biosecurity or pest management. Territorial authorities are responsible for local-level land use management (urban and rural planning); network utility services such as water, sewerage, stormwater and solid waste management; local roads; libraries; parks and reserves; and community development. Property rates (land taxes) are used to fund both regional and territorial government activities. There is often a high degree of co-operation between regional and territorial councils as they have complementary roles. Resource management functions[edit] Regional councils have these specific functions under the Resource Management Act 1991. Planning for the integrated management of natural and physical resources [9] Planning for regionally significant land uses [10] Soil conservation, water quality and quantity, water ecosystems, natural hazards, hazardous substances [11] Controlling the coastal marine area [12] Controlling via resource consents the taking, use, damming or diverting of water [13] Controlling via resource consents the discharge of contaminants [14] Establishing of rules in a regional plan to allocate water [15] Controlling via resource consents the beds of waterbodies [16] Other functions[edit] Regional councils have responsibility for functions under other statutes;[17] flood and river control under the Soil Conservation and Rivers Control Act 1941, reserves vested in regional councils under the Reserves Act 1977, civil defence under the Civil Defence Act 1990, regional pest management under the Biosecurity Act 1993, harbour and water navigation under the Maritime Transport Act 1994, hazardous waste under the HSNO Act 1996, public transport planning under the Land Transport Act 1998, and supervision of the safety of dams under the Building Act 2004.[18] List of regions[edit] Region Regional council Chair Council seat Island Area (km²)[19] Population[20] ISO 3166-2 Code 1 Northland Northland Regional Council Bill Shepherd[21] Whangarei North 12,498 168,300 NZ-NTL 2 Auckland (1) Auckland Council Len Brown Auckland North 4,940 1,570,500 NZ-AUK 3 Waikato Waikato Regional Council Paula Southgate Hamilton North 23,900 439,200 NZ-WKO 4 Bay of Plenty Bay of Plenty Regional Council John Cronin Whakatāne North 12,071 287,100 NZ-BOP 5 Gisborne (1)(2) Gisborne District Council Meng Foon Gisborne North 8,386 47,400 NZ-GIS 6 Hawke's Bay Hawke's Bay Regional Council Fenton Wilson Napier North 14,137 160,100 NZ-HKB 7 Taranaki Taranaki Regional Council David MacLeod Stratford North 7,254 115,800 NZ-TKI 8 Manawatu-Wanganui Horizons Regional Council Bruce Gordon Palmerston North North 22,221 234,500 NZ-MWT 9 Wellington Greater Wellington Regional Council Chris Laidlaw[22] Wellington North 8,049 496,900 NZ-WGN 10 Tasman (1) Tasman District Council Richard Kempthorne Richmond South 9,616 49,500 NZ-TAS 11 Nelson (1) Nelson City Council Rachel Reese Nelson South 424 49,900 NZ-NSN 12 Marlborough (1) Marlborough District Council Alistair Sowman Blenheim South 10,458 45,300 NZ-MBH 13 West Coast West Coast Regional Council Ross Scarlett Greymouth South 23,244 32,700 NZ-WTC 14 Canterbury Canterbury Regional Council Margaret Bazley Christchurch South 44,508 586,500 NZ-CAN 15 Otago Otago Regional Council Stephen Woodhead Dunedin South 31,209 215,100 NZ-OTA 16 Southland Southland Regional Council Ali Timms Invercargill South 31,195 97,300 NZ-STL (1) These regions have unitary authorities. (2) The Gisborne Region is still widely but unofficially known by its former name (East Cape) or as East Coast. Areas outside regional boundaries[edit] Some outlying islands are not included within regional boundaries. The Chatham Islands is not in a region, although its council has some of the powers of a regional council under the Resource Management Act. The Kermadecs and the subantarctic islands are inhabited only by a small number of Department of Conservation staff, and the Conservation Minister is empowered to act as a regional council for these islands. Governance[edit] Regional councils are popularly elected every three years in accordance with the Local Electoral Act 2001.[23] Councils may use a first past the post or single transferable vote system. The chairperson is selected by the elected council members.[24] Distance table[edit] This section does not cite any sources. Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources.

Predecessors of current structure[edit] Auckland[edit] Main article: Auckland Regional Council The Auckland Regional Council was preceded by the Auckland Regional Authority (ARA), which existed from 1963 to 1989. Wellington[edit] The Wellington Regional Council was first formed in 1980 from a merger of the Wellington Regional Planning Authority and the Wellington Regional Water Board.[25] United councils[edit] In 1978, legislation was passed enabling the formation of regions with united councils. Twenty regions were designated, excluding the Auckland and Wellington areas. For most of the country this was the first regional level of government since the abolition of provinces in 1876. Councillors were not elected directly – they were appointed from the various territorial local authorities (TLAs) within the region. The only responsibilities mandated by the legislation were coordination of civil defence and development of a regional plan, although the constituent TLAs could agree on additional responsibilities at the point of formation of each united council. For example, in a number of cases the united council took responsibility for the allocation of revenue from regional petrol taxes. The united councils were based in the facilities of the largest TLA in the region and largely dependent on the TLAs for resources. They were allowed to levy rates but in most cases had minimal operating budgets (below $100,000 per annum). The notable exception was Canterbury, where the united council had a number of responsibilities. Only one united council undertook any direct operational activity – a forestry project in Wanganui.[7] List of united councils Region United council formed Rates levy (1982/83) Northland January 1980 $118,000 Thames Valley July 1980 $46,000 Waikato October 1980 $36,000 Bay of Plenty August 1979 $17,000 Tongariro November 1979 $50,000 East Cape August 1979 $16,000 Hawkes Bay December 1983 – Taranaki February 1979 $60,000 Wanganui May 1979 $81,000 Wairarapa November 1978 $33,000 Manawatu May 1981 0 Horowhenua June 1980 $47,000 Nelson Bays November 1978 $84,000 Marlborough December 1978 $30,000 Canterbury May 1979 $605,000 West Coast November 1978 $32,000 Aorangi 1983 – Coastal / North Otago April 1983 – Clutha / Central Otago November 1980 $33,000 Southland May 1979 $88,000 Source: Summary of the Functions and Activities of United Councils.
