User talk:Cigsy - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia User talk:Cigsy From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search Your edits to RADIUS have nothing to do with RADIUS itself. RADIUS is not about security or privacy at all, it's an authentication protocol. WIFI doesn't even use RADIUS on the client side. You might be confused with EAP, which is transported by RADIUS from the access point to the ISP authentication server (in some setups). RADIUS is only part of the infrastructure to authenticate you, it certainly doesn't provide you with Wifi security. --Bluezy (talk) 08:39, 3 August 2008 (UTC) Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Cigsy&oldid=229552363" Navigation menu Personal tools Not logged in Talk Contributions Create account Log in Namespaces User page Talk Variants Views Read Edit New section View history More Search Navigation Main page Contents Featured content Current events Random article Donate to Wikipedia Wikipedia store Interaction Help About Wikipedia Community portal Recent changes Contact page Tools What links here Related changes User contributions Logs Upload file Special pages Permanent link Page information Print/export Create a book Download as PDF Printable version Languages This page was last modified on 3 August 2008, at 08:39.
