The song features Lil Wayne and is a digital iTunes Store bonus track from Drake's second studio album, Take Care. "The Motto" premiered on Los Angeles' Power 106 on October 31, 2011.[1] Drake released the song on his OVO blog a day later.[2] It was first played on rhythmic top 40 radio stations on November 29, 2011 as the album's fourth single.[3] The song has a connection to the Hispanic/Latino band Aventura.[4] The track was a commercial success in the US, having sold over 3 million copies there.[5] It peaked atop both the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and US Rap Songs charts, and was ranked 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 Year-end Chart. "The Motto" was nominated for Best Rap Song at the 55th Grammy Awards.[6] The song is one of the few songs to rank within the top 20 in the year-end chart, but to never crack the top ten, due to peaking at number 14. A music video was released on YouTube on February 10, 2012 and features cameos from E-40 and Mistah F.A.B. as well. It directed by Lamar Taylor and Hyghly Alleyne.[7] The music video was shot in Oakland, California.

The song received a nomination at the 2013 Grammy Awards[8] Remixes and freestyles[edit] Drake, featuring Lil Wayne & Tyga[9] (Official remix) YG, Nipsey Hussle and Snoop Dogg[10] Nelly[11] (Released through the Mixtape O.E.MO) Jeremih[12] Mario[13] Tinie Tempah Christmas Freestyle Foku Me 100 Kila Young Jeezy and Freddie Gibbs[14] Wale and Meek Mill[15] Wiz Khalifa, Juicy J, Berner Nekfeu, Alpha Wann, Sneazzy West (1995) (France)[16] Chart performance[edit] The song debuted at #18 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart with first-week sales of 124,000.[17] In its 22nd week, it ascended to #14.[18] On the week of February 18, 2012, "The Motto" reached No. 1 on the US Rap Chart making it his 12th No. 1 on the chart and extending his lead as the artist with the most No. 1 hits since the chart began. The song has sold 3,113,000 copies in the US as of April 2013.[5] Cultural impact[edit] The song uses the phrase YOLO, an acronym for "you only live once".[19] The phrase can be seen in youth culture: for example, a high school prank in Chicago, Illinois, involved high school students chanting "YOLO."[20][21] Some people have graffitied YOLO on walls.[22][23] It has become a popular Twitter hashtag.[24] Some youth have said that it is their motto,[25][26] and actor Zac Efron got a tattoo with the acronym.[27] Some youth, however, have taken action against the "YOLO" mindset; hip hop artist Joey Bada$$ released a song entitled "Death of YOLO" on his album Summer Knights. The song uses nearly dying in a car accident, a result of the "YOLO" lifestyle, as a metaphor for living making poor decisions.[28] The hip-hop magazine Da South reported that the rapper Lecrae has deconstructed the motto YOLO in his answer song "No Regrets".[29] The Washington Post describes YOLO as "the newest acronym you'll love to hate".[30] The Huffington Post says: "YOLO is dumb."[31] The phrase "you only live once" is commonly attributed to Mae West,[32][33] but variations of the phrase have been in use for over 100 years,[34] including as far back as (the German equivalent of) "one lives but once in the world" by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in the play Clavigo in 1774,[35] and as the title of a waltz Man lebt nur einmal! ("You Only Live Once!") by Johann Strauss II in 1855.
