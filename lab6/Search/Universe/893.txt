List of Presidents of the United States - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia List of Presidents of the United States From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search "Presidents of the United States", "American Presidents" and "U.S. Presidents" redirect here. For the C-SPAN series, see American Presidents: Life Portraits. For other uses, see President of the United States (disambiguation). For lists of U.S. Presidents based on other criteria such as age or home state, see Template:Lists of US Presidents and Vice Presidents. The White House in Washington, D.C. is the president's official residence, the center of the administration, and a prominent symbol of the office. The Official Seal of the President of the United States. Under the United States Constitution, the President of the United States is the head of state and head of government of the United States. As chief of the executive branch and face of the federal government as a whole, the presidency is the highest political office in the United States by influence and recognition. The president is also the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. The president is indirectly elected to a four-year term by an Electoral College (or by the House of Representatives, should the Electoral College fail to award an absolute majority of votes to any person). Since the ratification of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1951, no person may be elected president more than twice, and no one who has served more than two years of a term to which someone else was elected may be elected more than once.[1] Upon the death, resignation, or removal from office of an incumbent president, the vice president assumes the office. The president must be at least 35 years of age, has to have lived in the United States for 14 years, and has to be a "natural born" citizen of the United States. This list includes only those persons who were sworn into office as president following the ratification of the United States Constitution, which took effect on March 4, 1789. For American leaders before this ratification, see President of the Continental Congress.[2] The list does not include any acting presidents under the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. There have been 43 people sworn into office, and 44 presidencies, as Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is counted chronologically as both the 22nd and 24th president. Of the individuals elected as president, four died in office of natural causes (William Henry Harrison,[3] Zachary Taylor,[4] Warren G. Harding,[5] and Franklin D. Roosevelt), four were assassinated (Abraham Lincoln,[6] James A. Garfield,[6][7] William McKinley,[8] and John F. Kennedy) and one resigned (Richard Nixon).[9] George Washington, the first president, was inaugurated in 1789 after a unanimous vote of the Electoral College. William Henry Harrison spent the shortest time in office with 32 days in 1841. Franklin D. Roosevelt spent the longest with over twelve years, but died shortly into his fourth term in 1945; he is the only president to have served more than two terms. A constitutional amendment, affecting presidents after Harry Truman, was passed to limit the number of times an individual can be elected president. Andrew Jackson, the seventh president, was the first to be elected by white men of all classes in 1828 after most laws barring non-land-owners from voting were repealed. Warren Harding was the first elected after women gained voting rights in 1920. Four presidents – John Q. Adams, Rutherford B. Hayes, Benjamin Harrison and George W. Bush – lost the popular vote but assumed office; Bush was subsequently re-elected with a popular majority. John F. Kennedy has been the only president of Roman Catholic faith, and the current president, Barack Obama, is the first president of African descent.[10] Contents 1 List of presidents 2 Living former presidents 3 Timeline 4 See also 5 Notes 6 References 7 External links List of presidents       Independent (1)       Federalist (1)       Democratic-Republican (4)       Democratic (16)       Whig (4)       Republican (18) № Portrait President Term of office Party Term [n 1] Previous office Vice President 1    George Washington (1732-02-22)February 22, 1732 – December 14, 1799(1799-12-14) (aged 67) [11][12][13] April 30, 1789 [n 2] – March 4, 1797 Non-partisan [14] 1 (1789) Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army (1775–1783) John Adams 2 (1792) 2    John Adams October 30, 1735 – July 4, 1826 (aged 90) [15][16][17] March 4, 1797 – March 4, 1801 [n 3] Federalist 3 (1796) 1st Vice President of the United States Thomas Jefferson 3    Thomas Jefferson April 13, 1743 – July 4, 1826 (aged 83) [18][19][20] March 4, 1801 – March 4, 1809 Democratic- Republican 4 (1800) 2nd Vice President of the United States Aaron Burr March 4, 1801 – March 4, 1805 5 (1804) George Clinton March 4, 1805 – April 20, 1812 [n 4] 4    James Madison March 16, 1751 – June 28, 1836 (aged 85) [21][22][23] March 4, 1809 – March 4, 1817 Democratic- Republican 6 (1808) 5th United States Secretary of State (1801–1809)   Vacant April 20, 1812 – March 4, 1813 [n 5] 7 (1812) Elbridge Gerry March 4, 1813 – November 23, 1814 [n 4] Vacant November 23, 1814 – March 4, 1817 [n 5] 5    James Monroe April 28, 1758 – July 4, 1831 (aged 73) [24][25][26] March 4, 1817 – March 4, 1825 Democratic- Republican 8 (1816) 7th United States Secretary of State (1811–1817) Daniel D.

For example, George Washington served two consecutive terms and is counted as the first president (not the first and second). Upon the resignation of 37th president Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford became the 38th president even though he simply served out the remainder of Nixon's second term and was never elected to the presidency in his own right. Grover Cleveland was both the 22nd president and the 24th president because his two terms were not consecutive. A period during which a vice-president temporarily becomes acting president under the Twenty-fifth Amendment is not a presidency, because the president remains in office during such a period. ^ Instead of being inaugurated on March 4, 1789, George Washington's first-term inaugural was postponed 57 days (1 month and 27 days) to April 30, 1789, because the U.S. Congress had not yet achieved a quorum. ^ a b c d e f g h i j Unseated (lost re-election). ^ a b c d e f g h i j k Died in office of natural causes. ^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r Prior to ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1967, there was no mechanism by which a vacancy in the Vice Presidency could be filled. Richard Nixon was the first president to fill such a vacancy under the provisions of the Twenty-fifth Amendment when he appointed Gerald Ford. Ford later became the second president to fill a vice presidential vacancy when he appointed Nelson Rockefeller to succeed him. ^ a b c Resigned. ^ a b c Later sought election or re-election to a non-consecutive term. ^ Being the first vice president to assume the presidency, Tyler set a precedent that a vice president who assumes the office of president becomes a fully functioning president who has his own presidency, as opposed to just a caretaker president. His political opponents attempted to refer to him as "acting president", but he refused to allow that. The Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution put Tyler's precedent into the Constitution. ^ Former Democrat who ran for vice president on Whig ticket. Clashed with Whig congressional leaders and was expelled from the Whig party in 1841. ^ a b c d e f g h i j k Died in office ^ a b c d Assassinated. ^ a b Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson were, respectively, a Republican and a Democrat who ran on the National Union ticket in 1864. ^ Andrew Johnson did not identify with the two main parties while president and tried and failed to build a party of loyalists under the National Union label. His failure to build a true National Union Party left Johnson without a party. ^ The Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution went into effect in 1933, moving the 1937 inauguration day from March 4 to January 20, and shortening this term by 43 days. ^ Dwight Eisenhower is the first president to have been legally prohibited by the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution from seeking a third term. ^ Sought an election for a full term, but was unsuccessful References ^ "The Constitution: Amendments 11–27".
