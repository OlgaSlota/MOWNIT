Łukasiewicz logic - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Łukasiewicz logic From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search This article is about a logic in mathematics. For the similarily named Łukasiewicz notation, see Polish notation. In mathematics, Łukasiewicz logic (/luːkəˈʃɛvɪtʃ/; Polish pronunciation: [wukaˈɕɛvʲitʂ]) is a non-classical, many valued logic. It was originally defined in the early 20th-century by Jan Łukasiewicz as a three-valued logic;[1] it was later generalized to n-valued (for all finite n) as well as infinitely-many-valued (ℵ0-valued) variants, both propositional and first-order.[2] The ℵ0-valued version was published in 1930 by Łukasiewicz and Alfred Tarski; consequently it is sometimes called the Łukasiewicz-Tarski logic.[3] It belongs to the classes of t-norm fuzzy logics[4] and substructural logics.[5] This article presents the Łukasiewicz[-Tarski] logic in its full generality, i.e. as an infinite-valued logic. For an elementary introduction to the three-valued instantiation Ł3, see three-valued logic.

The presence of conjunction and disjunction is a common feature of substructural logics without the rule of contraction, to which Łukasiewicz logic belongs. Axioms[edit] This section requires expansion with: additional axioms for finite-valued logics. (August 2014) The original system of axioms for propositional infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic used implication and negation as the primitive connectives: Propositional infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic can also be axiomatized by adding the following axioms to the axiomatic system of monoidal t-norm logic: Divisibility: Double negation: That is, infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic arises by adding the axiom of double negation to basic t-norm logic BL, or by adding the axiom of divisibility to the logic IMTL. Finite-valued Łukasiewicz logics require additional axioms. Real-valued semantics[edit] Infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic is a real-valued logic in which sentences from sentential calculus may be assigned a truth value of not only zero or one but also any real number in between (e.g. 0.25). Valuations have a recursive definition where: for a binary connective and and where the definitions of the operations hold as follows: Implication: Equivalence: Negation: Weak Conjunction: Weak Disjunction: Strong Conjunction: Strong Disjunction: The truth function of strong conjunction is the Łukasiewicz t-norm and the truth function of strong disjunction is its dual t-conorm. The truth function is the residuum of the Łukasiewicz t-norm. All truth functions of the basic connectives are continuous. By definition, a formula is a tautology of infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic if it evaluates to 1 under any valuation of propositional variables by real numbers in the interval [0, 1]. Finite-valued and countable-valued semantics[edit] Using exactly the same valuation formulas as for real-valued semantics Łukasiewicz (1922) also defined (up to isomorphism) semantics over any finite set of cardinality n ≥ 2 by choosing the domain as { 0, 1/(n − 1), 2/(n − 1), ..., 1 } any countable set by choosing the domain as { p/q | 0 ≤ p ≤ q where p is a non-negative integer and q is a positive integer }. General algebraic semantics[edit] The standard real-valued semantics determined by the Łukasiewicz t-norm is not the only possible semantics of Łukasiewicz logic. General algebraic semantics of propositional infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic is formed by the class of all MV-algebras. The standard real-valued semantics is a special MV-algebra, called the standard MV-algebra. Like other t-norm fuzzy logics, propositional infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic enjoys completeness with respect to the class of all algebras for which the logic is sound (that is, MV-algebras) as well as with respect to only linear ones. This is expressed by the general, linear, and standard completeness theorems:[4] The following conditions are equivalent: is provable in propositional infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic is valid in all MV-algebras (general completeness) is valid in all linearly ordered MV-algebras (linear completeness) is valid in the standard MV-algebra (standard completeness). Font, Rodriguez and Torrens introduced in 1984 the Wajsberg algebra as an alternative model for the infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic.[6] A 1940s attempt by Grigore Moisil to provide algebraic semantics for the n-valued Łukasiewicz logic by means of his Łukasiewicz–Moisil (LM) algebra (which Moisil called Łukasiewicz algebras) turned out to be an incorrect model for n ≥ 5. This issue was made public by Alan Rose in 1956. C. C. Chang's MV-algebra, which is a model for the ℵ0-valued (infinitely-many-valued) Łukasiewicz-Tarski logic, was published in 1958. For the axiomatically more complicated (finite) n-valued Łukasiewicz logics, suitable algebras were published in 1977 by Revaz Grigolia and called MVn-algebras.[7] MVn-algebras are a subclass of LMn-algebras, and the inclusion is strict for n ≥ 5.[8] In 1982 Roberto Cignoli published some additional constraints that added to LMn-algebras produce proper models for n-valued Łukasiewicz logic; Cignoli called his discovery proper Łukasiewicz algebras.[9] References[edit] ^ Łukasiewicz J., 1920, O logice trójwartościowej (in Polish).
