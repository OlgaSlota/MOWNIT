Theo died six months after Vincent, leaving the work in the possession of his widow, Johanna van Gogh-Bonger.[10] Selling many of Vincent's paintings with the ambition of spreading knowledge of his artwork, Johanna maintained a private collection of his works. The collection was inherited by her son Vincent Willem van Gogh in 1925, eventually loaned to the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam where it was displayed for many years, and was transferred to the state-initiated Vincent van Gogh Foundation in 1962.[10] Dedicated museum[edit] Vincent van Gogh - Self-portrait with pipe, 1886, Van Gogh Museum Design for a Van Gogh Museum was commissioned by the Dutch government in 1963 to Dutch architect and furniture designer Gerrit Rietveld.[11] Rietveld died a year later, and the building was not completed until 1973,[12] when the museum opened its doors.[13] In 1998 and 1999, the building was renovated by the Dutch architect Martien van Goor[14] and an exhibition wing by the Japanese modernist architect Kisho Kurokawa was added.[15] Starting in late 2012, the museum was closed for renovations for six months. During this period, 75 works from the collection were shown in the Hermitage Amsterdam.[16] On September 9, 2013, the museum unveiled a long-lost Van Gogh painting that spent years in a Norwegian attic believed to be by another painter. It is the first full-size canvas by him discovered since 1928. Sunset at Montmajour depicts trees, bushes and sky, painted with Van Gogh's familiar thick brush strokes. It can be dated to the exact day it was painted because he described it in a letter to his brother, Theo, and said he painted it the previous day July 4, 1888.[17] Art thefts[edit] In 1991, twenty paintings were stolen from the museum, among them Van Gogh's early painting The Potato Eaters. Although the thieves escaped from the building, 35 minutes later all stolen paintings were recovered from an abandoned car. Three paintings – Wheatfield with Crows, Still Life with Bible, and Still Life with Fruit – were severely torn during the theft.[18] Four men, including two museum guards, were convicted for the theft and given six or seven-year sentences.[19] It is considered to be the largest art theft in the Netherlands since the Second World War.[20] In 2002, two paintings were stolen from the museum, Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen and View of the Sea at Scheveningen.[21] Two Dutchmen were convicted for the theft to four-and-a-half-year sentences, but the paintings were never recovered.[22][23] The museum has offered a reward of €100,000 for information that leads to the recovery of the paintings.[24] The FBI Art Crime Team has listed the robbery on their Top Ten Art Crimes list, and estimates the combined value of the paintings at 30 million US dollars.[25] Buildings[edit] The museum is situated at the Museumplein in Amsterdam-Zuid, on the Paulus Potterstraat 7, between the Stedelijk Museum and the Rijksmuseum.[26] The museum consists of two buildings, the Rietveld building, designed by Gerrit Rietveld, and the Kurokawa wing, designed by Kisho Kurokawa.[27] The museum offices are housed on Stadhouderskade 55 in Amsterdam-Zuid.[26] Rietveld building[edit] Staircase in the Rietveld building The Rietveld building is the main structure of the museum and exhibits the permanent collection. The building has a rectangular floor plan and is four stories high. On the ground floor are a shop, a café, and the introductory part of the art exhibition. The first floor shows the works of Van Gogh grouped chronologically. The second floor gives information about the restoration of paintings and has a space for minor temporary exhibitions. The third floor shows paintings of Van Gogh's contemporaries in relationship to the work of Van Gogh himself.[28] Kurokawa wing[edit] The Kurokawa wing is used for major temporary exhibitions.
