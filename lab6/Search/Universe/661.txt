However, sometimes certain laws in a federal state are uniform across the constituent states and enforced by a set of federal courts; with a result that the federal state forms a single jurisdiction for that purpose. It is also possible for a jurisdiction to prosecute for crimes committed somewhere outside its jurisdiction, once the perpetrator returns[3] In some cases, a citizen of another jurisdiction outside its own can be extradited to where a jurisdiction where the crime is illegal, even if it was not committed in that jurisdiction.[4][5] Unitary states are usually single jurisdictions, but the United Kingdom is a notable exception; it has three separate jurisdictions due to its three separate legal systems.
