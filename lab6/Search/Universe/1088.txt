Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Poland and the United Kingdom are divided into constituencies, while the other member states have a single national constituency. In Germany, political parties are entitled to present lists of candidates either at Länder or national level. The Kingdom of Denmark was also historically subdivided in two constituencies, with a separate one for Greenland which was dissolved in 1985 after the autonomous country in the Realm withdrew from the EEC (later expanded to become the EU). Currently, all member states hold elections to the European Parliament (EP) using various forms of proportional representation.[note 1] The number of representatives per head of population varies widely across constituencies. For example, 77,000 German speaking Belgians have one representative, while Greater London have one seat for every 980,000 people. The quantity of MEPs representing each country, anyway, is approximately proportional to the population of that member state within the European Union. Data are for the 2014–2019 legislature.
