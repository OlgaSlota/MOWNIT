Landmarks[edit] Hohentwiel The most famous landmark of Singen is Hohentwiel, a volcanic stub on which there are the ruins of a fortress destroyed by French troops during the Napoleonic Wars. World War 2 'Singen route'[edit] Singen is notable in military history for the Singen route in World War II. This route into Switzerland was discovered by Dutch naval lieutenant Hans Larive in 1940 on his first escape attempt from an Oflag (prisoner's camp for officers) in Soest. After being captured at the Swiss border near Singen, the interrogating Gestapo officer was so confident the war would soon be won by Germany that he told Larive the safe way across the border. Larive did not forget and many prisoners later escaped using this route - that included Larive himself, Francis Steinmetz, Anthony Luteyn, Airey Neave, Pat Reid and Howard Wardle in their escapes from Colditz Castle when Colditz was used in the war as Oflag IV-C.[2] Sister cities[edit] Singen is twinned with: La Ciotat, France, since 1968 Pomezia, Italy, since 1974 Celje, Slovenia, since 1989 Kobeliaky, Ukraine, since 1993 References[edit] ^ "Gemeinden in Deutschland mit Bevölkerung am 31.
