Southwestern Tai languages - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Southwestern Tai languages From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation, search Thai Southwestern Tai Geographic distribution: Southeast Asia Linguistic classification: Tai–Kadai Tai Zuojiang–Thai Nung–Thai Wenma–Southwestern[1] Sapa–Thai Thai Proto-language: Proto-Thai Subdivisions: Southern Thai Central–Eastern Thai Glottolog: sout3184[2] Distribution of the Southwestern Tai languages. The Southwestern Tai AKA Thai languages are an established branch of the Tai languages of Southeast Asia. They include Siamese (standard Thai), Lao, and Shan in Burma. Contents 1 Classification 1.1 Chamberlain (1975) 1.2 Edmondson & Solnit (1997) 1.3 Luo (2001) 1.4 Pittayaporn (2009) 2 Languages 3 References 4 External links Classification[edit] The internal classification of the Southwestern Tai languages is still not well agreed on. Chamberlain (1975)[edit] Chamberlain (1975) divides Southwestern Tai into 4 branches.[3] Chamberlain based his classification on the following phonological patterns. (Note: For an explanation of the notation system for Tai tones, see Proto-Tai language#Tones.) /p/ vs. /ph/ tone *A column split/merger pattern tone *BCD columns split/merger patterns B-DL tonal coalescence Proto-Southwestern Tai Branch with distinguishing innovation: /p/ Branch with distinguishing innovation: *A 1-23-4 Tse Fang Tai Mao Muang Ka Branch with distinguishing innovation: *ABCD 123-4; B=DL Black Tai Red Tai White Tai Lue Shan Yuan Ahom Branch with distinguishing innovation: /ph/ (*A 1-23-4) Branch with distinguishing innovation: *BCD 123-4 Siamese Phu Tai Nuea[4] Phuan Branch with distinguishing innovation: *BCD 1-23-4; B≠DL Lao Southern Thai Tai Muong Vat of Yen Chau, Vietnam is a PH-type language like Lao, even though it is geographically surrounded by Black Tai (Theraphan 2003; Chamberlain 1984).[5][6] Edmondson & Solnit (1997)[edit] Edmondson & Solnit (1997) divide the Southwestern Tai languages into two major subgroups. According to this classification, Dehong Tai and Khamti are the first languages to have split off from the Southwestern Tai branch.[7] Northern: Tai Nua = Shan-Tayok (Chinese Shan), Khamti Southern: Burman Shan ("Shan proper"), all other Southwestern Tai A transition zone between the Northern and Southern groups occurs among the Tai languages (including Tai Mau) around the Burma-China border region of Mangshi, Namhkam, and Mu-se near Ruili. This bipartite division of Southwestern Tai is argued for by Edward Robinson in his paper "Features of Proto-Nüa-Khamti" (1994). The following features set off the Nüa-Khamti group from all the other Southwestern Tai languages. Labialized velar stops have become velar stops. Tripartite split of the A tone A1-23-4 Merger of A23 and B4 The low vowels /ɛ/ and /ɔ/ have merged with /e/ and /o/, respectively. *ʔb > m Luo (2001)[edit] Luo Yongxian (2001) also recognizes the uniqueness of Dehong Tai (Tai Nüa), but argues for that it should be placed in a separate Northwestern Tai branch with Southwestern Tai as a sister branch.[8] Luo claims that the Northwestern Tai branch has many Northern Tai and Central Tai features that are not found in Southwestern Tai. His proposed tree for the Tai branch is as follows. Tai Northern Central Southwestern Northwestern Pittayaporn (2009)[edit] See also: Tai languages § Pittayaporn (2009) According to Pittayaporn (2009:301), Southwestern Tai (his subgroup Q) is defined by a phonological shift of *kr- → *ʰr-.[9] Pittayaporn (2014) also suggests that Southwestern Tai began to disperse southward after the 7th century C.E. but before the 11th century C.E. (between 700 and 1000 C.E., during the late Tang dynasty or early Song dynasty), as evidenced by loanwords from Late Middle Chinese.[10] Languages[edit] Southern Thai (Pak Thai) is often posited to be the most divergent; it seems to retain regular reflexes of early tonal developments that were obscured in the other (Central–Eastern) languages. The reconstructed language is called Proto-Thai; cf. Proto-Tai, which is the ancestor of all of the Tai languages. The following tree follows that of Ethnologue. Southern Thai (Pak Thai) (Thailand) Chiang Saen languages (10) Tai Dam (Black Tai; Vietnam, Thailand, Laos) Northern Thai (Lanna, Tai Yuan; Thailand, Laos, Burma) Phuan (Thailand) Thai Song (Thailand) Siamese (Central/Standard Thai; Thailand) Tai Dón (White Tai, Tai Kao; Vietnam, China) Tai Daeng (Vietnam) Tay Tac (Vietnam) Thu Lao (Vietnam) Lao–Phutai languages (4) Lao (Laos) Lao Nyo (Cambodia, Thailand) Phu Thai (Thailand) Isan (Northeastern Thai) (Thailand, Laos) Northwestern Tai languages (9) Ahom (Assam – extinct. Modern Assamese is Indo-European.) Lü (Lue, Tai Lue; China, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Burma) Khamti (Assam, Burma) Tai Laing (Tai Lai; Burma) Khün (Kuen; Burma) Khamyang (Assam) Shan (Tai Shan, Dehong; Burma) Tai Aiton (Assam) Tai Nüa (China, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos) Tai Phake (Assam) Turung (Assam) According to Ethnologue, other Southwestern languages are Tai Ya (China), Pu Ko (Laos), Pa Di (China), Tai Thanh (Vietnam), Tai Long (Laos), Tai Hongjin (China), Yong (Thailand). It is not clear where they belong in the classification above. Ethnologue also lists under Tai, without further classification, Kuan (Laos), Rien (Laos, evidently spurious), Tai Do (Viet Nam), Tai Pao (Laos), and Tay Khang (Laos). Geographically these would all appear to be Southwestern.[11] Ethnologue also includes Tày Sa Pa (Sapa) of Vietnam, which Pittayaporn excludes from Southwestern Tai but classifies as the most closely related language outside of that group. Pittayaporn also includes Yoy, which Ethnologue classifies as a Northern Tai language.[11] References[edit] ^ Nordhoff, Sebastian; Hammarström, Harald; Forkel, Robert; Haspelmath, Martin, eds.
