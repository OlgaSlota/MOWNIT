In the late 18th century the land became part of the Connecticut Western Reserve in the Northwest Territory, then was purchased by the Connecticut Land Company in 1795. Cuyahoga County was created on June 7, 1807 and organized on May 1, 1810.[9][10] It was later reduced by the creation of Huron, Lake, and Lorain Counties.[11] It was named after the Cuyahoga River. Cuyahoga County in 1874 Geography[edit] According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,246 square miles (3,230 km2), of which 457 square miles (1,180 km2) is land and 788 square miles (2,040 km2) (63%) is water.[12] It is the second-largest county in Ohio by total area. A portion of Cuyahoga Valley National Park is located in the southeastern portion of the county.

As of 2012, this consisted of two small areas: Chagrin Falls Township and Olmsted Township.[26] Cuyahoga County had long been led by a three-member Board of County Commissioners. In July 2008, Federal Bureau of Investigation agents began raiding the offices of Cuyahoga County Commissioners and those of a wide range of cities, towns, and villages across Cuyahoga County. The investigation revealed extensive bribery and corruption across the area, affecting hundreds of millions of dollars in county contracts and business. The investigation led to the arrest of county commissioner Jimmy Dimora; county auditor Frank Russo; MetroHealth vice president John J. Carroll; former Strongsville councilman Patrick Coyne; former Ohio District Courts of Appeals judge Anthony O. Calabrese III; former Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas judge Bridget McCafferty; Cuyahoga County Sheriff Gerald McFaul; former Cleveland City Council member Sabra Pierce Scott; Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas judge Steven Terry; and a wide range of attorneys, building inspectors, consultants, contractors, school district employees, and mid and low level county workers.[27] On November 3, 2009, county voters overwhelmingly approved the adoption of a new county charter which replaced the three-commissioner form of county government with an elected county executive and county prosecutor, and an 11-member county council. Each council member represents a single geographic district; there are no at-large districts. The elected offices of auditor, clerk of courts, coroner, engineer, recorder, sheriff, and treasurer were abolished. The county executive was given authority to appoint individuals to these offices, which became part of the executive branch of the county. Summit County is the only other Ohio county with this form of government.[28] In the November 2, 2010, election, Lakewood mayor Ed FitzGerald (D) defeated Matt Dolan (R) to become the first Cuyahoga County Executive.[29] The first Cuyahoga County Council was also elected, with Democrats winning eight seats, while Republicans won three.[30] Politics[edit] Cuyahoga County is heavily Democratic in voter registration. Presidential election results, 1960–2012 Year Democratic Republican 2012 68.84% 420,953 30.17% 184,475 2008 68.50% 441,836 30.44% 196,369 2004 66.57% 448,503 32.89% 221,600 2000 62.62% 359,913 33.42% 192,099 1996 60.75% 341,357 29.15% 163,770 1992 52.72% 337,548 29.24% 187,186 1988 58.79% 353,401 40.33% 242,439 1984 55.65% 362,626 43.60% 284,094 1980 50.02% 307,448 41.47% 254,883 1976 56.03% 349,186 41.01% 255,594 1972 48.15% 317,670 49.94% 329,493 1968 53.95% 363,540 35.44% 238,791 1964 71.50% 492,911 28.50% 196,436 1960 59.83% 429,030 40.17% 288,056 Education[edit] Colleges and universities[edit] Cuyahoga County is home to a number of higher education institutions, including: Baldwin Wallace University (Berea) Cleveland Bartending School Cleveland Heights Case Western Reserve University (Cleveland) Cleveland Institute of Art (Cleveland) Cleveland Institute of Music (Cleveland) Cleveland State University (Cleveland) Cuyahoga Community College (Cleveland, Highland Hills, Westlake and Parma) DeVry University (Seven Hills) John Carroll University (University Heights) Notre Dame College (South Euclid) Kent State University College of Podiatric Medicine (Independence) Stautzenberger College, Brecksville (Brecksville) Ursuline College (Pepper Pike) Health[edit] In 2014, Cuyahoga County ranked 65 out of 88 total counties in Ohio for health outcomes. This ranking was based on multiple factors including: premature death (7,975 years per 100,000 population, of potential life lost), adults who reported having poor or fair health (15%), average number of poor physical health days reported in a 30-day period (3.3), average number of poor mental health days reported in a 30-day period (4.1), and the percentage of births with low birth-weight (10.4%). Among these factors Cuyahoga did worse than the Ohio average in premature death, poor mental health days, and low birth-weight. Possible explanations as for why Cuyahoga County is lower in health outcomes than the average Ohio county include behavioral factors, access to clinical care, social and economic factors, and environmental factors.[31] The leading causes of death and disability in Cuyahoga County are chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease, obesity and diabetes.[32] The cancer mortality rate for Cuyahoga is 192.7 per 100,000 people, the mortality rate due to heart disease is 204.2 per 100,000 people, and the percentage of adult residents that are obese is 26.2%.[33] Community Comparison of Disparities[edit] According to The Fox Chase Cancer Center, a health disparity can be defined as the existence of inequalities that prevent certain members of a population group from benefiting from the same health status as other groups.[34] Within Cuyahoga County there are many health disparities when comparing cities and demographics. The Hough neighborhood in Cleveland and Lyndhurst can be compared to illustrate some of the disparities. The communities are both in Cuyahoga County and are less than 10 miles apart. They also have similar populations, but a different racial breakdown according to the 2010 US Census. The population of the Hough neighborhood was 16,359 (96.1% Black or African American and 2.1% White American)[35] and the population of Lyndhurst was 14,001 (6.4% Black or African American and 90.3% White American).[36] There is a disparity of 24 years between the life expectancy in the two communities.[37] The residents of the Hough neighborhood have a life expectancy of 64 years and residents in Lyndhurst have a life expectancy of 88.5 years.[38] The annual median income in the Hough neighborhood is $13,630[37] while it is $52,272 in Lyndhurst.[36] Data collected from the Center for Community Solutions indicated from 1990 to 2001 the rate of heart disease for residents of the Hough neighborhood was around four times the frequency of Lyndhurst residents. The rate of accidental deaths were nine times higher the Hough neighborhood.[38] Health facilities[edit] University Hospitals Ahuja Medical Center - Beachwood University Hospitals Bedford Medical Center - Bedford Cleveland Clinic - Cleveland Euclid Hospital - Euclid Fairview Hospital - Cleveland Hillcrest Hospital - Mayfield Heights Huron Hospital - East Cleveland University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center - Cleveland Lakewood Hospital - Lakewood Lutheran Hospital - Cleveland University Hospitals MacDonald Women's Hospital - Cleveland Marymount Hospital - Garfield Heights MetroHealth Medical Center - Cleveland University Hospitals Parma Medical Center - Parma Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital - Cleveland University Hospitals Richmond Medical Center - Richmond Heights South Pointe Hospital - Warrensville Heights Southwest General Health Center - Middleburg Heights St. Anne's Hospital, historical facility in Cleveland St. John Medical Center - Westlake St. Vincent Charity Medical Center - Cleveland University Hospitals Case Medical Center - University Circle, Cleveland Healthspan (formerly Kaiser Permanente of Northeast Ohio) - Bedford, Cleveland, Cleveland Heights, & Parma Transportation[edit] Airports[edit] Cuyahoga County is served by international, regional and county airports, including: Cuyahoga County Airport Cleveland Hopkins International Airport (Cleveland) Cleveland Burke Lakefront Airport (Cleveland) Major highways[edit] Interstate 71 Interstate 271 Interstate 77 Interstate 80 (Ohio Turnpike) Interstate 480 Interstate 90 Interstate 490 U.S. Route 6 U.S. Route 20 U.S. Route 42 U.S. Route 322 U.S. Route 422 Recreation[edit] Cuyahoga County is served by the Cleveland Metroparks system.
