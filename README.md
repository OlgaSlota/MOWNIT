Numerical Analysis :
- lab1 : 
- -sinus and cosinus series expansion by comparison with java.lang.Math.sin() and java.lang.Math.cos()
- -Partial Sums method ( comparing double and float precision , summing forward and backward )
- -Logistic Map , Bifurcation Diagram ( JavaPlot for results presentation), also comparison between double and float precision
 

- lab2 :
- - Gaussian-Jordan ellimination for solving linear equotatiions with complete pivoting compared to library solution in LibSolution.java
- - LU factorization with partial pivoting
- - Electric cuircuit analysis based on Kirchhoff's Rules. Given a graph representing an electrical cuircuit, solving a linear equation set for current on each branch in a cuircuit (represented as an edge in a graph).
